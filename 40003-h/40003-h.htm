<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="alcap">his</span> book is the first of a series which the
Publisher intends to issue, illustrative of life and
adventure in the Australian Colonies and the Islands
of the Pacific. It has been carefully compiled from
reliable sources of information&mdash;viz., <i>Wills's Diary</i>,
<i>King's Narrative</i>, <i>Howitt's Diary</i>, Wood's <i>Explorations
in Australia</i>, Withers's <i>History of Ballarat</i>, Sutherland's
<i>Tales of the Gold-fields</i>, Raffello's <i>Account of the
Ballarat Riots</i>, McCombie's <i>History of Victoria</i>, etc.,
etc. Most of these books are very expensive or out
of print, and therefore not easily procurable at the
booksellers.</p>

<p>In the succeeding volumes of the series it is proposed
to give&mdash;"Buckley, the Runaway Convict, and his
Black Friends," "John Batman, the Founder of
Melbourne," "Fawkner, the Pioneer," "Early Days
of Tasmania," "Botany Bay Tales," "Remarkable

<p><span class="disnone">T</span><span class="alcap">here</span> stood for twenty years,
at the intersection of Collins
and Russell Streets, the only
monument which the city of
Melbourne can boast of. Increasing
traffic has recently
necessitated its removal to a
small reserve opposite our
Parliament Houses, where it
occupies a most commanding
position at one of the chief entrances of the city. It
is the lasting memorial of two men and the
expedition they led across the continent of Australia.
It stands in silent and solemn grandeur amidst the
noisy turmoil of a busy thoroughfare&mdash;two massive
figures gazing earnestly and longingly, seemingly in
a solitude as complete as the deepest seclusion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
lonely plains of the interior, where the heroes whose
memory they perpetuate met their fate. No inscription
tells the curious visitor or wayfarer who they
are, or records the deeds that have gained them such
a high place in the estimation of the citizens of
Victoria. The story is an old one in these days of
rapidly passing events, but we think it will bear
repetition, and, therefore, in the following pages we
will do our best to relate the events that led to the
erection of so magnificent a memorial.</p>

<p>From the days of the first settlement of New
South Wales at Port Jackson in 1788, down to the
present time, the laudable desire of bettering their
condition, enhanced by the adventurous spirit moving
in their breasts, has prompted the colonists of
Australia to organise parties for the exploration of
the unknown interior of their vast continent. In not
a few instances the explorer has been the precursor
of the squatter and the selecter of settlements and
civilisation. The journey of Oxley, in 1818, led to
the discovery that the Macquarie and other rivers
ended in large reedy marshes. This discovery gave
rise to the belief in an immense inland sea, into
which all the rivers of the interior emptied themselves.
But subsequent travellers in search of this
supposed inland sea dissipated the belief in its
existence. In 1828 Sturt reached the "great salt
river," called the Darling, which has since filled such
an important part in facilitating the carriage of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
staple product to the ocean. In his next journey
Sturt went down the Murrumbidgee and the Murray
as far as Lake Alexandrina. His description of the
country surrounding the lake&mdash;plenty of green pastures
and abundance of agricultural land of the most
fertile kind&mdash;induced the squatters to send down
their emaciated flocks from the parched plains of
Riverina, and also led to the emigration of numbers
of farmers and vine-growers from overcrowded
Europe, who founded the Colony of South Australia.
Mitchell, in 1836, descended the Darling, crossed
over the Murray, and entered into what is now the
Colony of Victoria. He named it "Australia Felix,"
because the country which met his view delighted
him with its beautiful scenery, and its congenial
climate presented such a pleasant contrast to that of
the land he had just travelled over. Pioneers from
Port Jackson and Van Diemen's Land migrated to
this newly-revealed district. The productiveness of
its soil, and the subsequent discovery of gold, soon
attracted a great number of adventurers and immigrants
to the happy clime. In an incredibly short
period the district grew into a rich and prosperous
colony, and Melbourne, its mighty capital, took rank
amongst the chief cities of the world.</p>

<p>The success attending the early exploring expeditions
equipped by the mother colony seems to have
incited the colonists of Victoria to emulate the doings
of their neighbours. In 1859 a patriotic offer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
made by an enterprising citizen of Melbourne&mdash;Mr.
Ambrose Kyte&mdash;to contribute £1000 towards
defraying the cost of fitting out an expedition to
explore the vast interior of Australia. This generous
offer was accepted. The project was taken up by
the Royal Society of Victoria, and the sum of £3400
was raised by public subscription. The Government
voted £6000, and granted an additional £3000 for
the purchase of camels in India. Thus originated,
under the most favourable auspices, the Victorian
Exploring Expedition, which is now more commonly
known, owing, no doubt, to its calamitous termination,
as the "Burke and Wills' Expedition."</p></div><!--img010-->

<p>The Exploration Committee had some trouble in
obtaining a suitable leader. Several well-known
explorers were written to, but each of them declined.
At last the appointment was given to Mr. Robert
O'Hara Burke, a man of approved ability, and in
himself actuated by an enthusiastic desire to perform
the hitherto unaccomplished feat of crossing our vast
continent from sea to sea.</p>

<p>Mr. Burke was an Irishman, born in 1821, and was,
therefore, only forty years old at the time of his
melancholy end. He had served in the Austrian
Cavalry, and also in the Irish Mounted Constabulary,
previous to his arrival in Van Diemen's Land, in
1853. After performing services as Acting Inspector
at Hobart Town and as Police Magistrate at Beechworth
(Victoria), he was granted leave of absence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
order to go to England, where he hoped to obtain
a commission in one of the regiments embarking
for the seat of the war then waging between England
and Russia. Being unsuccessful, owing to the termination
of the war, he returned to Victoria, and
shortly received an appointment as one of the
superintendents of the Victorian Police Force, which
position he held until the setting out of the exploring
expedition. Mr. Burke diligently prepared
himself for the journey across the continent. He
examined the records of previous expeditions for the
personal experiences of former explorers, as well as
for knowledge of the interior already at hand. He
also made severe walking tours, in order to qualify
himself physically for the unusual hardships accompanying
such a journey. The following characteristic
letter, written whilst <i>en route</i>, will show his
determination to succeed in his undertaking:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="lttail">
"<span class="smcap">On the Darling</span>, <i>4th October 1860</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear S&mdash;&mdash;</span>,
</p>

<p class="ti2">"I received your letter, and was glad to hear of the
safe arrival of your friend B&mdash;&mdash;. We have been resting here
a few days, awaiting the arrival of the baggage, which has
just come up. To-morrow we proceed on, and I shall not
delay anywhere until I reach Cooper's Creek&mdash;being an
Irishman I must add, unless I can't help it.</p>

<p>"I leave the hired waggons and my own behind. The
accursed impediments, the ruin of so many expeditions, I am
determined shall not ruin me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>"We all march on foot three or four hundred miles at all
events, and the camels and horses will have to carry our weight
in provisions.</p>

<p>"We have already done so for the last forty miles. You
should have seen old B&mdash;&mdash;'s face, upon my announcing that all
the officers would have to act as working men, and that we
should only carry 30 lbs. weight of baggage for each man.</p>

<p>"Loading camels and then marching twenty miles is no joke.
The first two days of it nearly choked poor B&mdash;&mdash;, and I think
he will not be able to stand it much longer.</p>

<p>"I am still confident of success, and willing to accept the
alternative of success or disgrace, although failure is possible.
This self-imposed task (as you justly call it) is no sinecure,
and I think will take the sting out of me if I see it out.
Good-bye, my dear S&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

"From yours, ever sincerely,</p>

<p class="lttail">"R. O'HARA BURKE."</p>

<p>In William John Wills we see the real hero of the
expedition. He was an Englishman, born in Devonshire,
and at his untimely end was but twenty-seven
years of age. He was endowed with an unquenchable
thirst for knowledge. It manifested itself on the
voyage out, where, in addition to his other studies, he
acquired a knowledge of the science of navigation.
After his arrival in Victoria, in 1853, his taste for
science, which was also accompanied by a naturally
courageous and enterprising spirit, displayed itself.
At first he obtained an appointment in the Survey
Department. He gained a knowledge of astronomical
and other sciences to which the Observatory is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
dedicated, and was then admitted, through the influence
of the Surveyor-General, into that establishment
as an assistant. As early as 1855 the friends of
young Wills had frequently heard him speak of his
intention to explore the unknown interior of Australia,
and to be one of the first to reach the shores
of the Gulf of Carpentaria. In 1856 a proposal was
mooted to send out an expedition, and, on hearing of
this, Mr. Wills walked from the river Wannon to
Ballarat, a distance of ninety miles, to offer his services;
but the project was abandoned. His scientific
attainments had qualified him for an important post
in the expedition of 1860, and he joined it in the
capacity of astronomical and meteorological observer.
Of his fitness for exploring, the Rev. Julian Woods
writes&mdash;"Having studied every journal connected
with Australian exploration, and become, as it were
personally acquainted with all our discoverers, I conscientiously
say I have not met with so courageous,
so noble, so fine an explorer as William John Wills."</p>

</div>

<p>The other officers of the expedition were:&mdash;Mr.
Landells, who had brought the camels to the colony,
and was appointed second in command; Dr. Herman
Beckler, botanist and medical adviser of the expedition;
and Dr. Ludwig Becker, artist, naturalist, and
geological surveyor. There were eleven subordinates,
including three Hindoo camel-drivers.</p>

<p>On the 20th August 1860 the expedition left Melbourne.
During the morning of its departure crowds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of holiday folks were to be seen wending their various
ways to the Royal Park, on the northern outskirts of
the city. It was late in the afternoon before the
picturesque groups of camels and horses, with their
keepers and the baggage, were arranged in marching
order. Then Mr. Burke, on a little grey horse, took
up his position at the head of the procession. When
it was about to start, the Mayor of Melbourne
mounted one of the drays and delivered a short
speech, wishing them God-speed. Mr. Burke uncovered,
and replied, in a clear voice that was heard
all over the crowd:&mdash;"Mr. Mayor, on behalf of myself
and the expedition, I beg to return you my most
sincere thanks. No expedition has ever started
under such favourable circumstances as this. The
people, the Government, the Committee&mdash;all have
done heartily what they could do. It is now our
turn! and we shall never do well till we justify what
you have done in showing you what we can do."
Then, amidst the loud cheering and acclamations of
the spectators, who numbered fully ten thousand, the
brilliant cavalcade was put in motion. It was truly a
fine, imposing spectacle, and the applauding cheers
of the enthusiastic citizens were prolonged till the
procession had faded away in the dim distance.</p>

<p>The progress of the explorers through the settled
districts to the river Darling was very slow, and even
before they reached Menindie serious dissensions had
broken out in their camp. On arriving at that town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>ship Burke dismissed the foreman, and Mr. Landells
resigned his position and left the party. Mr. Wills
was then appointed second in command, and instead
of Mr. Landells, Burke placed in charge of the camels
a man named Wright, whom he had picked up at a
sheep station.</p>


<div class="figcenter">

</a>
<p class="caption smcap">Cooper's Creek.</p>
</div>

<p>The Exploration Committee had instructed Burke
to establish a depôt on Cooper's Creek, and make a
line of communication between it and the Darling.
When the explorers reached that river the spring
season was far advanced, and soon the fervid rays of
the sun would wither the green grass and dry up the
water-courses; therefore Burke decided to push forward
to the creek without delay. But some of the
camels were unfit to proceed immediately, so Burke
divided his party, and with seven of his companions
and Wright, who offered to show him a direct and
well-watered track, set out from Menindie on the 19th
of October.</p>

<p>They accomplished more than half of the journey,
and having been fortunate in finding good feed and
water on the way, Burke sent Wright back to the
encampment on the Darling with instructions to bring
the rear party with the heavy supplies on by easy
stages to Cooper's Creek. On the 11th of November,
thirteen days after despatching Wright, Burke
and his party arrived safely at the creek. They then
travelled slowly along the banks of the stream,
recruiting the animals and looking around for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
camping-ground. On the twenty-first they pitched
on a suitable locality, and there established the
main depôt.</p>

<p>Whilst awaiting the arrival of Wright with the
remainder of the company, frequent excursions were
made in order to find a route to the north. On one
of these excursions, Mr. Wills travelled ninety miles
without finding water; their camels escaped from
them, and he and his companions were forced to
return on foot. Fortunately for them they found a
pool on their way back to the depôt, but the camels
were never recovered. On another occasion Wills
and King got into a stony desert. The knowledge
obtained by means of these and other short excursions
was not of an encouraging nature to the
explorers.</p>

<p>After waiting at Cooper's Creek for more than a
month, the advance party grew tired of their life of
inaction, and made preparations for the journey to
the Gulf of Carpentaria. As Wright did not come
forward as expected, Burke got impatient, and decided
to subdivide the few men he had with him as
follows:&mdash;Four men were to remain at the depôt, one
of them named William Brahé in command; and
were to construct a stockade while waiting for
Wright, and when he had arrived they were to seek
a more available and direct route to the Darling.
The rest of the little party&mdash;Burke, Wills, King, and
Gray&mdash;were to push forward to the Gulf, and were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
take with them six of the camels, one horse, and
three months' provisions.</p>

<p>On 16th December the little band of explorers
bade their companions good-bye, and started northwards.
As they proceeded, Burke and Wills walked
ahead, while Gray and King followed behind, leading
the horse and the six camels. Burke himself seldom
wrote, but Wills, every evening after taking astronomical
observations, wrote his diary, and then read
it to Burke, who made such alterations in it as he
thought necessary. Their allowance of provisions
were a pound of flour and a pound of meat daily,
with a little rice occasionally, and the party camped
out every evening without tents. In his admirable
history of the <i>Exploration of Australia</i>, a work published
in 1865, and containing, in addition to the
adventures of the explorers, a very lucid description
of the physical features of the continent, so far as
they had been made known by the journeys and discoveries
previous to the year 1863, the Rev. Mr.
Woods writes in reference to this journey:&mdash;"No
doubt this self-denying mode of proceeding was very
heroic and courageous, but was it necessary? It
certainly does seem a pity that after the great care
taken to equip the party adequately, that its main
work should have been done by a feeble party, badly
provisioned, and subject to the disadvantage of crossing
the country on foot. The work was done, it is
true, but done in an imperfect way. No one could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
expect four poorly-fed men to manage six camels, to
force their way through untrodden scrubs, and yet
keep a journal and make observations. No one
could expect it, and it was not done. The journal
left is most incomplete, and to this day several
portions of the route are still matters of dispute."</p>

<p>For some distance the exploring quartette travelled
over well-watered country. Numerous parties of
natives were met with, but they were friendly to the
whites. Mr. Wills writes of a tribe of these:&mdash;"They
pestered us to go to their camp and have a
dance, which we declined. They were very troublesome,
and nothing but a threat to shoot them will
keep them away. They are, however, easily frightened;
and although fine-looking men, decidedly not
of a warlike disposition. They show the greatest
inclination to take whatever they can, but will run no
unnecessary risk in so doing. They seldom carry
any weapon except a shield and a large kind of
boomerang, which I believe they use for killing rats,
etc. Sometimes, but very seldom, they have a large
spear; reed spears seem to be quite unknown to
them. They are undoubtedly a finer-looking race of
men than the blacks on the Murray and Darling, and
more peaceful; but in other respects I believe they
will not compare favourably with them. They
appear to be mean-spirited and contemptible in
every respect." After the explorers had passed
through this fertile country, they had to cross about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
twenty miles of stony desert. On the other side of
it they came upon an earthy plain of about nine
miles. Then another nine miles of travelling through
swampy plains brought them to the banks of a magnificent
stream. The four men followed up this creek
from point to point of the bends, and on the 7th of
January camped well within the tropics. Afterwards
they entered upon immense fertile plains, with innumerable
creeks coursing through them, on the banks
of which gum and box-trees and splendid grass grew
luxuriantly. Pigeons and wild ducks were also found
in abundance. For five days the travellers marched
over these flourishing plains. Then they crossed
over a series of low sandstone hills, and after passing
over a stony plain came upon a range of mountains,
which they called the Standish Ranges. On 27th of
January the explorers reached Cloncurry Creek, one
of the derivative streams of the river Flinders. They
had afterwards to travel over swampy ground; the
camels could not be got along, so all of them were
abandoned. On the 9th of February, King and Gray
were left behind with the bulk of the provisions,
while Burke and Wills, taking the horse with them
to carry supplies sufficient for three days, pushed
forward towards the sea. They had to cross over
patches of swampy ground; a great deal of it was so
soft and rotten that the horse got bogged, and it was
only by digging him out that he could be extricated.
After great difficulty and delay they managed to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
this. Then they came across some tableland, and
beyond that a plain covered with water, which in
some places reached up to their knees. After wading
through several miles of this swamp, they came again
to dry land. Further on they met a few natives, who,
on seeing the explorers, decamped immediately,
leaving behind in their hurried departure some yams,
which were at once appropriated to appease the sharp
hunger of Burke and Wills. A small distance beyond
they reached a narrow inlet on the shore of the Gulf
of Carpentaria. A forest of Mangroves intercepted
their view of the open sea beyond, so the two heroic
men attempted to advance through it. The horse
had by this time become too weak to advance further,
therefore they hobbled him, and hastened forward
without him. But the two gallant fellows were soon
obliged to relinquish their attempt to pierce the thick
undergrowth. They could not obtain a view of the
open ocean, although they made every effort to do so.
'Tis true their mission was accomplished; they had
crossed the continent to within a mile or two of its
northern shore&mdash;the victory was gained! But now
the necessities of the case compelled the triumphant
explorers to immediately hurry back to Cooper's
Creek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="chsub"><i>THE RETURN JOURNEY.</i></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="alcap">he</span> two leaders returned to King and Gray on
the 12th February 1861. The explorers soon
afterwards recaptured all the camels, which had
been greatly improved in condition by their rest.
The remainder of the return journey was singularly
disastrous. At first the progress was very much
retarded by the incessant rain that deluged the whole
country. Sickness commenced with Gray, and then
Burke suffered a severe attack of dysentry, owing to
his having eaten of the flesh of a large snake that he
had killed. Their provisions became sadly reduced,
and one camel, then another, had to be killed, in order
to eke out their scanty supplies. On 6th of March
one of the camels became bogged, and they were compelled
to leave it. On the 20th, 60 lbs. of baggage
were abandoned. They killed another camel on the
30th, and on the 6th of April they killed the horse,
which had by this time become so weak that it could
scarcely stand upright. By the 13th of April they had
got back again to the Stony Desert. All were now
nearly exhausted by their continued privations, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
they slowly marched on in the hope of meeting
assistance before they reached the depôt. On the
16th they, with poor Gray strapped to the back of a
camel almost as emaciated as himself, managed to
travel seven miles; but during the night the unfortunate
fellow succumbed under his extreme sufferings.
His surviving companions, too, were all so weak in
body that they could scarcely scratch a grave in the
desert deep enough to cover his body. These three
gaunt, emaciated, and sorrow-stricken beings rested
but for a day, and then started afresh on their
lonesome and weary journey, abandoning everything
except the two camels, the fire-arms, and a little meat.
On the 20th they made a tremendous effort by
travelling all night, Burke riding one camel, and
Wills and King the other. All next day they
struggled manfully on, expecting soon to rest their
aching limbs and worn-out bodies in the camp at
Cooper's Creek. But on reaching the place where
they had left the depôt party, instead of seeing the
white tents of the camp gleaming in the rays of the
declining sun, they saw nothing but the stockade now
deserted by its former occupants. <i>There was no one
there!</i> On looking eagerly around their eyes fell
on the word DIG, cut in the bark of a tree. They
anxiously turned up the soil, and unearthed a small
parcel of provisions and a bottle containing a letter
from Brahé, in which the disappointed men read with
sinking hearts that he and his party had left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
depôt <i>only that very morning</i>. The document ran
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="lttail">
"Depôt, Cooper's Creek, <i>April 21st, 1861</i>.
</p>

<p>"The depôt party of the V.E.E. leaves this camp to-day to
return to the Darling. I intend to go S.E. from camp 60
deg., to get into our old track near Bulloo. Two of my companions
and myself are quite well; the third, Patten, has been
unable to walk for the last eighteen days, as his leg has been
severely hurt when thrown by one of the horses. No one has
been up here from the Darling. We have six camels and
twelve horses in good working condition.</p>

<p class="lttail">
"WILLIAM BRAHE."</p></div>

<p>This was appalling news to the brave explorers,
who, with their more than four months' severe
travelling and unparalleled privations, were almost
paralysed, and so exhausted that the slightest
exertion produced in their pain-racked bodies such
sensations of torture and utter helplessness as to
render them more fit for a hospital than any further
efforts on their part whatever. We will now leave
the three abandoned men to recover from the first
shock of their bitter disappointment, while we relate
the circumstances that prevented the depôt party
remaining at their post.</p>

<p>Previous to departing from Cooper's Creek, Burke
sent a despatch to the Exploration Committee. In
it he writes:&mdash;"I have every confidence in Brahé.
The feed is good. There is no danger to be apprehended
from the natives. There is nothing, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to prevent the party remaining here until our return,
or until their provisions run short." Burke's verbal
instructions to Brahé were very indefinite. He led
him to understand that the depôt party should remain
at Cooper's Creek for three months, and that if the
advance party did not return within that time the
camp could be broken up, and Brahé and his party
would be at liberty to quit the creek.</p>

<p>Brahé waited for four months and five days. The
natives were troublesome for the most of the time,
and confined the party to the camp. The men began
to sicken and complain of scurvy, and as Wright with
the rest of the company and provisions did not make
an appearance, Brahé deemed it prudent to retrace
the route from the Darling. His party went very
slowly the first day, and camped a few miles down
the creek. Had the ill-fated explorers of Burke's
party known this and followed on their track, in all
probability the fatal consequences of this desertion
would have been avoided. It is deplorable to think
that the three haggard men did not know that the
other party were so near, and that after partaking of
a hearty supper they slept all that night within a few
miles of their returning companions.</p>

<p>Burke, Wills, and King rested for a couple of days
at the abandoned depôt. The change of diet worked
wonders in improving their strength and cheering
their depressed spirits, and on the 23rd of April they
felt equal to the task of resuming their journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Burke's plan was that they should make for Adelaide,
by way of Mount Hopeless (an ill-omened name),
where there was a large sheep station, and which he
thought could not be further than one hundred and
fifty miles off. Wills urged that they should return
the way they came; the distance to the Darling
certainly was greater, being three hundred and fifty
miles, but they were sure of feed and water all the
way. Unfortunately for them all, as events afterwards
proved, Wills yielded to Burke's decision, and
the little party started for the mount. As they were
about to leave the depôt, Burke deposited in the
cache a letter from which we extract the following:&mdash;"We
have discovered a practical route to Carpentaria,
the chief portion of which lies on the 140th meridian
of east longitude. There is some good country
between this and Stony Desert. From there to
the tropics the country is dry and stony. Between
the tropics and the gulf a considerable portion is
rangey, but is well watered and richly grassed. We
reached the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria on the
11th of February." Their starting day was fine, and
the agreeable warmth of the weather lent fresh hopes
to the three men as they marched slowly along the
green banks of the creek. They were still further
elated by meeting with a few well-behaved blacks,
who gave them good supplies of fish in exchange for
some straps and matches. On the sixth day they
had a mishap&mdash;one of the camels became bogged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
beside a water-hole. They attempted to place boughs
and timber beneath him, but he sank too rapidly;
and being of a sluggish, stupid nature, could not make
sufficiently strenuous efforts towards extricating himself.
They then let in water from the creek so as
to buoy him up and soften the mud around his legs,
but it was of no avail; the brute lay there as if enjoying
himself. The next day they shot the beast dead,
cut off as much of his flesh as they could, and then
dried it in the sun. The following day the natives
very liberally presented them with a quantity of fish
and cake; the explorers returned the compliment
by giving them fish-hooks and some sugar. After
leaving the blacks, the three men struck a southerly
branch of Cooper's Creek, which they traced down
till its channel broke up into small water-courses, and
was at last lost in the sand. Then for two days they
travelled, looking around for some other stream,
but finding none, Burke and Wills left King with
the camel, and pushing ahead, found that the soil
became loose and cracked up; and as it appeared to
be more parched further south, they returned to
King.</p>

<p>The prospects of the little party now looked
gloomy. Their provisions were rapidly diminishing;
their clothing, and especially their boots, all going
to pieces; and their only remaining camel, which
had been ailing for some time, now showed signs
of being done up. But the two leaders determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to examine the creek more closely, and after a short
rest they set out again.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/illus-036a.jpg"><img src="images/illus-036.jpg" width="303" height="400" alt="On the March." title="On the March." />
</a>
<p class="caption smcap">On the March.</p>
</div>

<p>They came across some natives who were fishing.
The blacks, probably moved by the forlorn appearance
of Burke and Wills, gave them half of the fish
just caught, and promised further supplies if they
would come with them to their camp. On reaching
it the almost destitute explorers were treated most
generously&mdash;lumps of nardoo cake and handfuls of
fish were forced on them till they could positively eat
no more. The hospitable blacks also offered them
some stuff composed of dried stems and leaves of
shrubs, which, when chewed even in small quantities,
was highly intoxicating. The poor travellers could
only show their gratitude to the benevolent blacks by
tearing off and giving them two pieces of cloth from
their tattered macintoshes. Burke now returned to
King, while Wills continued for seven miles along the
creek until it tended northwards; then he returned,
passing through the blacks' camp on his way to rejoin
his companions. The natives invited him to stay,
and he was again hospitably entertained. After
supplying him with fish and nardoo cake, they
brought him a couple of rats baked in their skins.
Poor Wills must have been hungry, for he says "the
rats looked nice and were most delicious." Supper
over, one of the natives offered to share his gunyah
with the weary traveller, and all of them were very
attentive in bringing wood and keeping up the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
during the night. Early next morning Wills parted
from his black friends.</p>

<p>When he rejoined Burke and King he found them
jerking the flesh of the camel, for the poor beast had
become so weak and helpless that they had been
obliged to shoot it. The three men now despaired of
reaching the settled districts. The only prospect
before them was to wander about the creek, living
like the blacks until the arrival of a relief party. So
Burke and King went in search of the natives' camp
for the purpose of ascertaining where the seed grew
from which the natives made their bread, and also to
find their mode of preparing it. Wills remained
behind jerking the camel's flesh. In his diary he
cheerfully writes that he must devise some means of
trapping the birds and rats, but expresses deep regret
at being obliged to hang about the creek after having
made such a dashing trip to the Gulf of Carpentaria.</p>

<p>On reaching the spot where the blacks had camped,
Burke and King found the place deserted, so they
came back to Wills. The three dejected men moved
irresolutely in the direction of where the blacks had
been. Then Burke thought it better for one of them
to go back and stop with the things for a few days, so
that he might get the benefit of the remains of the
camel's flesh, whilst the other two should go forward
in search of the blacks and the nardoo. Accordingly,
Burke and King took four days' provisions and left
Wills at the junction, preparing for a final effort on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
their return. The two unfortunate men could not
find the blacks, so it was settled that the party should
abandon their cumbrous baggage and make another
effort to reach Mount Hopeless.</p>

<p>The next day, 17th of May, King found the nardoo
plant. This discovery revolutionised the feelings of
the weary explorers. Poor Wills, cheerful even in
this extremity, records the fact with the observation
that they were now in a position to support themselves
without the aid of the blacks. Collecting the
seeds was a slow and troublesome work, and the
three men were fully occupied in it for seven days.</p>

<p>This plant, the seeds of which answer the purposes
of flour among the natives, grows in little tufts close
to the ground. It resembles clover, but is quadrifoliate
instead of trifoliate, and its leaves are covered
with a silver down, which is also found on the seeds
when fresh. These grow upon separate short stalks
springing from the roots, and are flat and oval. The
gathering of them is generally done by the native
women, who, after cleaning the sand from them and
pounding them between two stones, bake the flour
into cakes.</p>

<p>The little party travelled for three days, tracing a
water-course until it lost itself in the flat country.
Travelling then became very fatiguing; over dreary
plains they struggled along almost exhausted. At
last, from sheer exhaustion, they were obliged to
relinquish the attempt to reach the mountain. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
took an hour's rest, and then wearily retraced their
steps.</p>

<p>In two days they reached the nearest water of the
creek, and lay down their worn-out bodies under the
cool shade of the box-trees growing on its fertile
banks. For a meal, they boiled some of the nardoo
seeds, and then made for the main creek. They came
across some native huts, in one of which they found
a pounding-stone left by the blacks. The poor
explorers found the work of pounding the seeds so
very slow and troublesome that they were compelled
to mix half flour with the badly-ground seeds. The
three men afterwards went back to their last camp
and brought up all the dried meat they had planted
there, and then remained at the deserted gunyahs,
gathering and pounding nardoo seeds, and living as
best they could. Whilst the poor fellows are thus
living on the lower part of Cooper's Creek we will
leave them, and turn back in order to find out the
causes of Wright's delays.</p>

<p>When Wright returned to Menindie he heard that
McDonall Stuart, the South Australian explorer, had
almost crossed the continent. Wright thought his
leader ought to know of this, so that if his own route
should fail he could turn westward, strike Stuart's
track, and continue the exploration northward. Two
of the men and a native were sent out in the vain
hope of overtaking Burke and informing him of this
new discovery, but they lost their way, and sent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
native back to Menindie with a slip of paper imploring
assistance. A relief party was sent out by
Wright. The two men were found living with the
blacks about one hundred and ninety miles away, and
were brought back to Menindie on 19th of December.
Wright now proved his utter unfitness for his responsible
position by remaining on the Darling for more
than a month after the return of this party. On 26th
of January he set out for Cooper's Creek, but proceeded
so leisurely that it was the 12th of February
before he reached Torowotto, the place where Burke
and he had separated three and a half months before.
It was now the hottest time of the year, and the
summer sun had dried up all the surrounding country
excepting the permanent creeks. Dr. Beckler and
three of the men became seriously ill with the scurvy,
and Wright erected a tent for them at Koorliatto
Creek, about twenty miles from Bulloo. He then
made for Bulloo, and from thence attempted to reach
Cooper's Creek, a distance of between seventy and
eighty miles; but in consequence of the hostility of
the natives he was unable to finish his journey, and
was forced to return. Dr. Beckler and the three men
were removed to Bulloo, and reached it on the 21st
of April, the day on which Burke and his two companions
arrived at the deserted depôt. A few days
afterwards two of the sick men died. The natives
had by this time become very troublesome, and the
party were compelled to build a stockade. At last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
they had to open fire upon them in order to disperse
them. Rats also abounded at the place, and did
considerable damage, even attacking the men.</p>

<p>On the 29th of April Wright was astonished to see
Brahé and the returning depôt party, and to hear
from them that they had neither seen nor heard
anything of the advance party for more than four
months. On the evening of the same day Dr. Beckler
died, and next day was buried. Wright was undecided
how to act&mdash;first he thought of returning to
Menindie, and turned back to Koorliatto Creek; but
when there he thought it possible that the advance
party might have returned to the depôt, so he and
Brahé left his party in the encampment and made
for Cooper's Creek.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May, while Burke and his two
companions were down at the lower part of the creek
making for Mount Hopeless, Wright and Brahé
arrived at the depôt, and seeing the place undisturbed
they concluded that the advance party had perished
in the journey northwards. Wright and Brahé made
a terrible blunder in not digging to see if the
provisions deposited by Brahé had been removed.
After a careless look around they returned to the
encampment at Koorliatto, and then the whole party
set out for the River Darling. Their progress was
slow, and another fatality occurred near Torowotto.
On the 6th of January, Patten, who had been
gradually sinking since he left the depôt with Brahé,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
succumbed under his privations. Wright's party
reached the Darling on the 18th of June, and immediately
sent despatches to the Exploration Committee,
begging that search might be made for the
advance party.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="chsub"><i>SUFFERINGS AND DEATHS OF THE TWO LEADERS.</i></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="alcap">e</span> will now take up the thread of the narrative
from where we left the enfeebled explorers
(Burke, Wills, and King) at the deserted gunyahs.
They adopted the life of the blacks, and managed
to subsist on the nardoo, although it was very
innutritious. More than a month had elapsed since
they had left the depôt, and Burke thought that
a relief party might have reached that place in the
interval. Wills now volunteered to return and
deposit, in place of Burke's former note, a letter
stating that the party were living on the lower part of
the creek, and also to bury there the field-books of
the journey to the Gulf. He expected to be away for
eight days, and took with him three pounds of flour,
four pounds of pounded nardoo, and one pound of
dried meat.</p>

<p>During his absence Burke and King had the
following adventure with the blacks (we have copied
the account of it from King's narrative):&mdash;"A few
days after Mr. Wills left, some natives came down
the creek to fish at some water-holes near our camp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
They were very civil to us at first, and offered us some
fish; the second day they came again to fish, and
Mr. Burke took down two bags, which they filled for
him; the third day they gave us one bag of fish, and
afterwards all came to our camp. We used to keep
our ammunition and other articles in one hut, and
all three of us lived together in another. One of
the natives took an oil-cloth out of this hut, and Mr.
Burke seeing him run away with it, followed him with
his revolver and fired over his head, and upon this
the native dropped the oil-cloth. While he was away,
the other blacks invited me away to the water-hole
to eat fish; but I declined to do so, as Mr. Burke
was away, and a number of natives were about who
would have taken all our things. When I refused,
one took his boomerang and laid it over my shoulder,
and then told me, by signs, that if I called out for
Mr. Burke as I was doing he would strike me. Upon
this I got them all in front of the hut and fired a
revolver over their heads, but they did not seem at
all afraid until I got out the gun, when they all
ran away. Mr. Burke, hearing the report, came
back, and we saw no more of them until late that
night, when they came with some cooked fish and
called out, 'White fellow!' Mr. Burke then went out
with his revolver, and found a whole tribe coming
down, all painted, and with fish in small nets carried
by two men. Mr. Burke went to meet them, and
they wished to surround him, but he knocked as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
many of the nets of fish out of their hands as he
could, and shouted out to me to fire. I did so, and
they ran off. We collected five small nets of cooked
fish. The reason he would not accept the fish from
them was that he was afraid of being too friendly,
lest they should be always at our camp." While
Burke was cooking some of the fish during a strong
wind, the flames caught the gunyah, and spread so
rapidly that the two men were unable either to
extinguish them or to save any of their things,
except one revolver and a gun.</p>

<p>How the heroic Wills fared on his lonely journey
is described in the following extracts taken from
his diary:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the 27th of May he came upon three black
gins and some children collecting nardoo, which was
so abundant in some places that the ground was
quite covered with it. The native women directed
him to their camp, and he was soon afterwards
overtaken by about twenty blacks, who were bent
upon taking him to it, promising him nardoo and
fish. One carried his shovel, another insisted in
such a friendly manner on taking his swag that
Wills could not refuse. They were greatly amused
with various little things he had. In the evening
he partook of a supper of fish and nardoo, and
one of the old men shared his gunyah with poor
Wills. The night was very cold. Next morning he
left the friendly blacks. During the day he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
very unwell. On the 29th the tottering man saw
some crows quarrelling about something near the
water. He found it to be a large fish. The crows
had eaten a large portion of it, but he, finding it
fresh and good, decided the quarrel by eating the
remainder of it. The fish proved a valuable addition
to his otherwise scanty meal of nardoo porridge.
That night he slept in a very comfortable mia-mia,
about eleven miles from the depôt. On the 30th of
May he reached his destination, but found no trace
of anybody except the blacks having been there,
although Wright and Brahé had visited the place
only twenty-two days before, at the time when
Burke and himself were being treated so generously
by the blacks on the lower part of the creek. He
deposited the journals and a notice stating the
wretched condition of himself and companions.
Next day he started on his return journey, although
his exertions had made him very tired and weak.
In the evening he camped under some bushes in a
sheltered gully, thinking he would reach the blacks'
camp next day. But next day he felt altogether
too weak and exhausted, and had extreme difficulty
in getting across numerous small gullies, and soon
was obliged to stop and rest himself. The following
morning at 6.30 he again started, thinking to breakfast
with the blacks, but found himself so very much
fatigued that he did not arrive at their camp till
ten o'clock; but his expectations of receiving a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
good breakfast were disappointed, for the camp was
by this time deserted. He rested here awhile, and
breakfasted off a few fish-bones which the blacks
had left. The disappointed man then started down
the creek, hoping by a late march to reach his companions,
but soon found this was out of the question.
By good luck he came across a large fish, about a
pound and a half in weight, being choked by another
which it had tried to swallow, but which had stuck
in its throat. The hungry man soon made a fire,
and had both fish cooked and eaten. He was
awakened next morning by the encouraging sounds
of cooeys, then fancied he saw smoke in the distance;
and was afterwards set at ease by hearing a cooey
from one of his former black friends, who also continually
repeated assurances of bread and fish. With
some difficulty the weary man managed to ascend
a sandy path leading to the natives' camp. He was
conducted by the chief to the fire, where there was
a large pile of fish cooked in the most approved
style. He imagined it was for general consumption
by the half-dozen natives who had gathered round;
but it turned out they had all eaten, and expected
Wills to dispose of it all. He set to work at the
task, and to his own astonishment accomplished it
by keeping two or three blacks steadily at work
extricating the bones for him. Fish finished, then
came a supply of nardoo cake and water, till he
was so full that he was unable to eat any more. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
native who called Wills to the camp allowed him a
short time to recover himself, and then filled a large
bowl with raw nardoo flour, and mixed it into a
thin paste. This mixture is a most insinuating
article to the blacks, and esteemed by them as a
great delicacy. They then invited Wills to stop,
but he declined; although, he says, he would have
liked to have stopped and lived with them in order
to learn something of their ways and manners. He
continued his return journey, and on the 6th of June
reached Burke and King.</p>

<p>The three men had been so well treated by the
blacks that they now decided on shifting their camp
nearer to them, and set out with such things as they
could carry, but found themselves very weak, in spite
of the abundant supplies of food they had lately had.
Poor Wills could scarcely get along, although carrying
the lightest swag (about 30 lbs.). They found
that the blacks had decamped from the place where
Wills had last seen them, so they moved on to the
camp near the nardoo field. The almost exhausted
men managed to reach the nardoo field, but, greatly
to their disappointment, no blacks were there. The
explorers took possession of the best mia-mia and
rested.</p>

<p>Until the 24th of June these unfortunate men
lived on the field, going out daily to gather the
nardoo, and then returning to the hut in order to
clean and pound the seeds. After eating the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
piece of dried camel's flesh, they found that although
the nardoo was in abundance, it was so innutritive that
by itself it could not support them. Wills it would
not sustain at all, and the poor young man wrote
in his diary: "I am determined to chew tobacco
and eat less of the nardoo." Burke, after a few
days, showed signs of caving in. King managed
to live on the nardoo; it seemed to agree with him
better than with his companions. However, Wills
became so weak as to be unable even to crawl about,
and on the 24th wrote: "Little chance of anything
but starvation unless we get hold of some blacks."</p>

<p>The little clothing they had could not keep out
the cold, and during the nights they suffered terribly
from it. Wills' wardrobe consisted of a wide-awake
hat, merino shirt, regatta shirt without sleeves,
remains of a pair of flannel trousers, and a waistcoat,
of which he had managed to keep the pockets
together. His companions were better off. The
three men had with them for bedding&mdash;two small
camel pads, some horsehair, two or three little bits
of rag, and pieces of oil-cloth saved from the fire.</p>

<p>It is impossible to imagine the state of mind these
three unfortunate men were then in. The expedition
that ended so disastrously for them had started ten
months before with the most brilliant prospects, and
now three of its members were on the point of starvation
and dying of fatigue. Unless they received
assistance very soon, the three men must undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
perish. After consulting together it was agreed that
Wills should be left alone in the gunyah, while his
two companions went in search of the blacks. With
great reluctance the two men packed up food enough
to last them a couple of days, but hesitated at leaving
their dying companion. They repeatedly desired
his candid opinion, and he again and again urged
them to go, saying, "It is our only chance." After
placing the nardoo and firewood near his bed, Burke
and King sorrowfully took leave of him; and then,
tottering along like two worn-out beggar-men, they
set out in search of succour.</p>

<p>Wills maintained the uniformity of his cheerful
disposition, and the last entry in his diary, written
without a complaint a few days before he expired,
moves us to admiration of his fine, manly qualities.
Here it is:&mdash;"I am weaker than ever, although I have
a good appetite and relish the nardoo much, but it
seems to give us no nutriment, and the birds here are
so sly as not to be got at. Even if we could get fish,
I doubt whether we could do much on that and
nardoo alone. Nothing now but the greatest good
luck can save any of us. As for me, I may live four
or five days if the weather continues warm. My
pulse is at forty-eight and very weak, and my legs
and arms are nearly skin and bone. I can only look
out, like Mr. Micawber, for something to turn up.
Starvation on nardoo is by no means unpleasant, but
for the weakness one feels and the utter inability to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
move one's self. As for my appetite, it gives me the
greatest satisfaction. Certainly, fat and sugar would
be more to one's taste; in fact, these seem to be the
great stand-by in this extraordinary continent. Not
that I mean to deprecate farinaceous food, but the
want of sugar and fat in all substances obtained here
makes them become almost useless to us as articles of
food without the addition of something else." Soon
after (perhaps a few hours) the departure of his companions,
the hand of death put an end to the
sufferings of poor Wills. It was a terribly hard fate
for one so young and full of promise to meet there in
the lonely wilderness, without the sympathetic and
encouraging presence of a friendly voice to break the
mournful silence, with no gentle hand to administer
the last kind soothing offices of humanity.</p>

<p>Let us now follow the two remaining sufferers. In
travelling the first day Burke seemed very weak, and
complained of great pain in his back and legs. Next
day he seemed better, and said he thought he was
getting stronger; but on starting did not get more
than two miles, when he found he could go no
further. King persisted in his trying to go on, and
managed to get him along several times, until Burke
was almost knocked up. He said he could not carry
his swag, and threw all he had away. King did
likewise, and took nothing but a gun, some powder
and shot, a small pouch, and some matches. They
did not go far before Burke said they should halt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the night. King prevailed on him to go a little
further on to a less exposed spot, where they camped.
King searched about and found a few small patches
of nardoo. He collected and pounded some of the
seeds, and with a crow which he had shot, the two
worn-out men made a good evening's meal. From
the time they halted Burke grew worse, and, although
he ate his supper, said he felt convinced he could not
last many hours. He gave King his watch and
pocket-book, and also wrote some notes. He then
said, "I hope you will remain with me here till I am
quite dead. It is a comfort to know that some one is
by; but when I am dying it is my wish that you
should leave my pistol in my right hand, and that you
leave me unburied as I lie." That night he spoke
very little. On the following morning he was speechless,
or nearly so, and about eight o'clock he expired.
Thus the gallant Burke ended his brave and noble
career. King saw there was no use remaining there
any longer, and wandered about in the most forlorn
condition. "I felt very lonely," he says. We can
well imagine that, and everything around must have
sadly reminded him of his late companions in misfortune.
He wandered up the creek in search of the
natives, and at night usually slept in deserted wurleys
belonging to them. Two days after leaving the spot
where Burke died he came across some gunyahs, in
one of which the natives had left a bag of nardoo
sufficient to last the hungry man a fortnight. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
remaining there two days he returned to Wills, taking
back with him two crows which he had shot.</p>

<p>On his arrival King found that his fellow-sufferer,
whom he had grown to love so dearly, was lying dead
in the hut, and that the natives had been there and
taken away some of the clothes. He buried the
corpse, and remained a few days. Then, as his stock
of nardoo was getting low, and he was unable to
gather any more, he tracked the natives that had
been in the camp by their footprints in the sand some
distance down the creek, shooting crows and hawks
on the road. Soon he came up to the blacks, and
afterwards kept with them until rescued by the relief-party.
How he lived we learn from his own
narrative:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The natives, hearing the report of the gun, came
to meet me, and took me with them to their camp,
giving me nardoo and fish. They took the birds I
had shot, and cooked them for me, and afterwards
showed me a gunyah, where I was to sleep with
three of the single men. The following morning they
commenced talking to me, and putting one finger on
the ground and covering it with sand, at the same
time pointing up the creek, saying, 'White fellow,'
which I understood to mean that one white man was
dead. From this, I knew that they were the tribe
who had taken Mr. Wills's clothes. They then asked
me where the third white man was, and I also made
the sign of putting the fingers on the ground, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
covering them with sand, at the same time pointing
up the creek. They appeared to feel great compassion
for me when they understood that I was
alone on the creek, and gave me plenty to eat. After
being four days with them, I saw that they were
becoming tired of me, and they made signs that they
were going up the creek, and that I had better go
downwards; but I pretended not to understand them.
The same day they shifted camp, and I followed
them; and on reaching their camp, I shot some
crows, which pleased them so much that they made
me a shelter in the centre of their camp, and came
and sat round until such time as the crows were
cooked, when they assisted me to eat them. The
same day one of the women, to whom I had given
part of a crow, came and gave me a ball of nardoo,
saying that she would give me more, only she had
such a sore arm that she was unable to pound. She
showed me a sore on her arm, and the thought struck
me that I would boil some water in the billy, and
wash her arm with a sponge. During the operation
the whole tribe sat around, and were muttering one
to another. The husband sat down by her side, and
she was crying all the time. After I had washed it, I
touched it with some caustic, when she began to yell
and ran off, crying, 'Mokow! mokow!' (Fire! fire!).
From this time she and her husband used to give me
a small quantity of nardoo both night and morning,
and whenever the tribe were about going on a fishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
excursion, he used to give me notice to go with them.
They also used to assist me in making a shelter
whenever they shifted camp. I generally shot a
crow, or a hawk, and gave it to them in return for
these little services. Every four or five days the
tribe would surround me, and ask whether I intended
going up or down the creek. At last I made them
understand that if they went up I should go up the
creek, and if they went down, I should also go
down; and from this time they seemed to look upon
me as one of themselves, and supplied me with fish
and nardoo regularly. They were very anxious, however,
to know where Burke lay, and one day when we
were fishing in the water-holes close by, I took them
to the spot. On seeing the remains, the whole party
wept bitterly, and covered them with bushes. After
this they were much kinder to me than before, and I
always told them that the white men would be here
before two moons; and in the evening, when they
came with nardoo and fish, they used to talk about
the 'white fellows' coming, at the same time pointing
to the moon. I also told them they would receive
many presents, and they constantly asked me for
tomahawks, called by them 'bomay ho.' From this
time to when the relief-party arrived, a period of
about a month, they treated me with uniform kindness,
and looked upon me as one of themselves. The
day on which I was released, one of the tribe who
had been fishing came and told me that the 'white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
fellows' were coming, and the whole of the tribe who
were then in camp sallied out in every direction to
meet the party, while the man who brought the
news took me over the creek, where I shortly saw
the party coming down."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="chsub"><i>SEARCH PARTIES AND CONCLUSION.</i></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="alcap">e</span> must now turn back to the time when Wright
reached the Darling. As soon as it was
known that Burke and the advance party had not
been heard of for five months after leaving Cooper's
Creek, great consternation was felt throughout all the
colonies, and relief parties were organised and
equipped with praiseworthy alacrity. A small contingent,
under Mr. A. W. Howitt, was furnished by
the Royal Society of Victoria, and started from
Melbourne early in July to examine the banks of
Cooper's Creek. On the 14th of August, McKinlay
was sent out by the South Australian Government,
with instructions to reach Cooper's Creek by way of
Lake Torrens. Before the end of the same month,
two other expeditions&mdash;one under Landsborough,
and another under Walker&mdash;had set out to explore
the region round about the Gulf of Carpentaria.
These expeditions all prosecuted their search with
eagerness, and through their instrumentality our
geographical knowledge of the interior was greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
extended; but Mr. Howitt's party was the only one
that succeeded in getting facts about the fate of the
explorers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a href="images/illus-062a.jpg"><img src="images/illus-062.jpg" width="400" height="264" alt="Burying the body of poor Wills" title="Burying the body of poor Wills" />
</a>
<p class="caption smcap">Burying the body of poor Wills</p>
</div>

<p>From his diary we learn that, with the assistance of
Brahé, the depôt was reached on the 13th of September,
and although this ill-fated place appeared to
them to be still undisturbed, they succeeded in finding
King on the fifteenth. He had been living with the
blacks for more than two months, and now presented
a melancholy appearance&mdash;wasted to a shadow,
and hardly to be distinguished as a civilised being
but by the remnants of clothes upon him. The
poor fellow was sitting in a hut, while the natives
were all gathered round, sitting on the ground
and looking on with a most gratified and delighted
expression.</p>

<p>After remaining two days to recruit King, Howitt
and four of the men set off with the intention of
burying the body of poor Wills. They found the
corpse covered with sand and rushes just as King had
left it, and when they had carefully collected the
remains they interred them where they lay. Mr.
Howitt showed their respect by conducting over the
grave a short funeral ceremony. Afterwards the
party heaped sand over the grave and laid bushes
upon it, that the natives might know by their own
tokens not to disturb the last repose of a fellow-being.
To mark the spot the following inscription was cut
on a tree close by:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<table summary="grave marker"><tr>

&mdash;A. H.&mdash;</p>
</div></td>
</tr></table>

<p>Mr. Howitt deferred his visit to Burke's remains,
hoping that King would be able to accompany him
thither; but finding it would not be prudent to
remove King for two or three days, he unwillingly
took such directions as King could give, and started
up the creek in search of the spot where Burke had
died. After travelling eight miles they found his
remains lying among tall plants under a clump of
box-trees. The bones were entire, with the exception
of the hands and feet, and the body had been removed
from the spot where it first lay, and where the
natives had placed branches over it, to about five
paces distant. The revolver, loaded and capped, was
lying close by, partly covered with leaves and earth,
and corroded with rust. A grave was dug, and the
remains of the brave explorer, wrapped in the Union-jack,
were gently placed therein. On a box-tree at
the head of the grave Mr. Howitt cut the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>The relief-party now went in search of the natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
who had been so hospitable to the unfortunate
explorers. On coming up to the blacks, Mr. Howitt
displayed to their astonished gaze some of the things
he intended to give them as a reward for their kindness.
They examined the knife and tomahawk with
great interest, but the looking-glass surprised them
most. On seeing their faces reflected in it some
seemed dazzled; others opened their eyes like
saucers and made a rattling noise with their tongues,
expressive of surprise. After a friendly palaver, Mr.
Howitt gave them some sugar to taste. They made
some absurd sleights-of-hand, as if in dread of being
poisoned, and only pretended to eat it. They were
then made to understand that the whole tribe were
to come up to the camp next morning to receive
the presents. On the following day, at ten o'clock,
the friendly blacks appeared in a long procession,
and at about a mile off commenced bawling at the
top of their voices. When collected together, just
below the camp, they numbered between thirty and
forty, and the uproar they made was deafening.
With the aid of King Mr. Howitt got them all
seated round him, and then distributed the presents&mdash;tomahawks,
knives, necklaces, looking-glasses,
combs, etc. The blacks behaved as if they had
never before experienced such happiness. The
piccanninies were brought forward by their parents
to have red ribbons tied round their dirty little heads.
One old woman, who had been particularly kind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
King, was loaded with presents. Fifty pounds of
sugar was divided amongst them, and soon found
its way to their mouths. Every one had a share
in a Union-jack pocket-handkerchief, which they were
very proud of. On fifty pounds of flour being given
to them, they at once called it "white fellow nardoo."
The blacks were made to understand that these
things had been given to them for having fed King.
Mr. Howitt then took leave of the delighted fellows,
and as he had now accomplished the object of his
journey, he bent his course homewards.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Melbourne the sad story which
he had to tell moved the minds and hearts of all,
and deep grief prevailed throughout Australia. In
Victoria the sorrow was intense, and it was agreed
that the bodies of the two gallant explorers who had
forfeited their lives in the nation's service should be
brought to Melbourne and accorded a public funeral.
Mr. Howitt was sent on the painful mission of bringing
down their remains, and returned with them at
the close of the year 1862. On the 21st of January
1863 the mournful ceremony took place. By common
consent the greater part of the shops in the
city were closed, although no official announcement
had been made intimating that the day should be
held sacred to the memory of Burke and Wills.
The remains of the explorers had been lying in state
at the Royal Society's Hall for a fortnight, and were
now placed in handsome coffins and conveyed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the grave, which is near Sir Charles Hotham's
monument. They were accompanied to their last
resting-place by the leading gentlemen of the colony,
and a procession which extended a distance of more
than half-a-mile; while the street pavements were
densely thronged with spectators. The Very Rev.
the Dean of Melbourne conducted the funeral service,
after which three volleys were fired. The melancholy
honours awarded to the brave explorers having been
paid amid general mourning, the crowd dispersed
and left the heroes in their quiet graves.</p>

<p>Honours of a more substantial kind were not
forgotten. To the nearest relatives of Burke and
Wills a large sum of money was voted by the
Government, and King received a grant that enabled
him to live comfortably for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>After the rewards had been given there was a less
pleasing duty to be done. It was generally agreed
that, with proper precautions, the disastrous termination
of the expedition could have been avoided.
The Government appointed a committee for the
purpose of sifting out the truth, and its members
examined every person in any way connected with
the expedition. The following is a summary of their
report:&mdash;That in dividing his party at Menindie, Mr.
Burke acted most injudiciously. He made an error
of judgment in engaging Mr. Wright, though a
pressing emergency had arisen for the appointment
of someone. Mr. Burke evinced more zeal than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
prudence in finally departing from Cooper's Creek
without having secured communication with the
settled districts, and also in undertaking so extended
a journey with an insufficient supply of food. The
conduct of Mr. Wright appears to be reprehensible
in the highest degree. The exploration committee
committed errors of a serious nature in not urging
Mr. Wright's departure from the Darling. The
conduct of Mr. Brahé in abandoning the depôt may
be deserving of considerable censure; but a responsibility
far beyond his expectations devolved upon him,
and his powers of endurance gave way when pressed
by the appeals of a sick comrade, who died shortly
afterwards. Many of the calamities might have been
averted, and none of his subordinates could have
pleaded contradictory orders, had Mr. Burke kept a
regular journal and given written instructions to his
officers. The report ends thus:&mdash;"We cannot too
deeply deplore the lamentable result of an expedition
undertaken at so great a cost to the country; but
while we regret the absence of any systematic plan
of operation on the part of the leader, we desire to
express our admiration of his gallantry and daring,
as well as the fidelity of his brave coadjutor, Mr.
Wills, and their more fortunate and enduring
associate, Mr. King; and we would record our deep
sympathy with the deplorable sufferings and untimely
death of Mr. Burke and his fellow-comrades."</p>

<p>Two years later a monument was erected in honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of the memory of Burke and Wills. It is a beautiful
statue in bronze, based on granite. The sculptor was
Mr. Charles Summers, an eminent Australian artist.
The materials are also Australian&mdash;the bronze is
composed of copper from Adelaide and tin from
Beechworth, and the granite was taken from the Harcourt
quarries. The bronze figures of Burke and
Wills stand about 12 feet high, and are mounted on a
granite pedestal, which is 15 feet high and 11 feet by
7 feet square at base. The attitude of the explorers
is a very suitable and effective one. Wills is in an
easy sitting posture, and Burke is standing erect with
his right arm resting on his comrade's left shoulder.
He is viewing the country towards the left, and is
apparently drawing the attention of his companion
to some of its particular features. Wills, with book
on his knee and pencil in hand, is just about to
make a note of them. The sides of the pedestals are
adorned with bronze bas-reliefs, which represent:&mdash;(1)
The starting of the expedition from the Royal
Park, Melbourne; (2) the return of Burke, Wills,
and King to Cooper's Creek from Carpentaria; (3)
the blacks weeping over the dead body of Burke;
and (4) the finding of King by Howitt's search
party.</p>

<p>On the 21st of April 1865 this stately monument
was unveiled in the presence of vast numbers of
people by Sir Charles Darling, Governor of Victoria.
After the uncovering ceremony was performed, Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Charles Darling delivered the following address,
which is condensed from the <i>Argus</i> of the 22nd of
April:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At the conclusion of the cheering His Excellency
said, 'Ladies and Gentlemen, Inhabitants of Victoria,
I need not tell you that the sounds which are still
reverberating are the echoes of what may be well
termed a national honour to the illustrious dead.
To make that honour as complete and perfect as
we can, you have assembled in the vast numbers
which meet the eye in every direction, and I accepted
the position which I now occupy in the appointed
ceremonial. On the 20th of August 1860 a gallant
company, now known to all posterity as the "Burke
and Wills Exploring Expedition," set forth, amidst
the enthusiastic cheers of assembled thousands of
their fellow-colonists, to win their way from the
southern to the northern shore of the Australian
continent. (Cheers.) A year had nearly passed away
when the fact was entertained beyond a doubt
that the victory had been nobly won, but that the
leaders, in the exhausting struggle, had fallen almost
in the hour of triumph. In the manner of their
deaths, it seems to me that the distinguishing characteristics
of each were strikingly illustrated. The
calm and philosophic Wills begins his last letter to
his father in these words&mdash;"These are probably the
last lines you will ever get from me; we are on the
point of starvation, not so much from the absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
want of food, but from the want of nutriment in what
we get;" and he concludes it with the tranquilly-expressed
opinion and assurance, "I think to live
about four or five days; my spirits are excellent."
Two days later, probably but a few hours before his
death, the last words recorded in his journal are
literally a scientific dissertation upon the nutritious
nature of the food&mdash;the nardoo plant&mdash;by means of
which they had for some time protracted their existence.
"Place," said the expiring Burke, instinctively
recurring to his early military days, and, as I doubt
not, with the picture of a fallen warrior upon the
battle-field vivid in his imagination, "place my
weapon in my hand, and leave me unburied as I lie."
Such was the fate of the men whom this day we
mourn and honour. Then came the universal sorrow,
the public funeral, the national provision for the
living, and, lastly, this monument in memory of the
dead. It cannot be said with truth that the people
of Victoria have raised this monument in any boasting
or vain-glorious spirit. It had its origin in a
far more noble source. It is designed as the imperishable
record of a deed which, not only on
account of its intrinsic importance, but also of the
high qualities which it developed in those who have
achieved it, is justly believed to be worthy of high
honour in the present generation and of future
generations. (Cheers.) When, hereafter, shall be
narrated the history of the sorrowful, yet successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
adventure which this statue is intended to commemorate,
it will be forgotten, or remembered only
with regret, that there was once cavil and contention
whether a sounder judgment, or&mdash;as men who have
learned to believe that the issue of great events are
little under the control of human wisdom may prefer
to call it&mdash;a more fortunate judgment might not
have been exercised, and a broader beam from the
light of experience brought to bear both upon the
inception and the execution of the exploring enterprise.
Nor should we, assembled as we are, not to
discuss the merits of the project, but to pay honour
to the memory of those who conquered the difficulties
which beset it, forget that, if it be true that amongst
those difficulties were the want of previous training
for, and special adaption to, the perilous task, so
much more were the glory and credit of the victory
enhanced. Nor will the sad tale of the fate of these
men be without its beneficial influence upon the intellectual
training and moral elevation of our people.
For, oft as it shall be told, and ofttimes it will be told
upon this very spot, Australian parents, pointing to
that commanding figure, shall bid their young and
aspiring sons to hold in admiration the ardent and
energetic spirit, the bold self-reliance, and the many
chivalrous qualities which combined to constitute the
manly nature of O'Hara Burke. (Cheers.) While
gazing on that more lowly and retiring form, they
may teach them to emulate the thirst for science, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
deep love of the Almighty's works in nature, the
warm and filial family affections, the devotion to
duty, self-control and submission of his own judgment
to authority which he regarded as rightly conferred
and exercised, and which, if I read the history of
his brief career aright, pre-eminently marked the
character and conduct of William Wills. (Cheers.)
Better for themselves, and might haply have averted
their melancholy end, if in Burke there had been
more of that practical wisdom which we call prudence,
and a larger measure of self-assertion and
desire to sustain his own opinion, in the character
of his unfortunate companion. Better, I
have said, for themselves, but not for the cause
of discovery and civilisation, for which they laid
down their lives; for who can doubt that the
knowledge of the country eastward of the line of the
successful exploration, which has been acquired by
the expeditions sent forth under the auspices of
this and the sister colonies, to endeavour to solve
the mystery of their fate, is immeasurably greater
than could have been reasonably expected to follow
for many years to come, had Burke and Wills
returned to enjoy the peaceful laurels they had
won? United in undying fame, all that was mortal
of them now rests in the same hallowed grave. Well
we know that "neither storied urn or animated bust"
can "back to its mansion call the fleeting breath."
"Honour's voice" cannot, indeed, "provoke the silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
dust;" if it could, well might their dust breathe again,
and be eloquent to-day. But what man can do has
now been done. There in the quiet cemetery will be
placed the "storied urn." Here in the thronged city
we have raised the "animated bust." It shall serve to
unite also in honoured memory the names and
effigies&mdash;the very form and semblance of these now
celebrated men, whose great exploit has shed such
lustre upon the records of exploration and discovery
in this our age, and engrafted so large a share
of interest and glory upon the earlier annals of
Victoria.'"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="chsub"><i>THE CONVICT'S STRATAGEM.</i></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="alcap">he</span> earliest discoverer of gold in Australia is
unknown to fame. Probably he was one of
that class of colonists whom Barrington, the pickpocket,
poet, and historian, describes in the oft-quoted
couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"True patriots we, for be it understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We left our Country for our Country's good;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and who were employed on the roads of the colony
and on the selections of its settlers in doing the rough
work incidental to the opening of a new country.
For the first report of the existence of the precious
metal we are indebted to the cunning of a convict,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
who attempted to regain his liberty by the following
stratagem. It is related by Governor Hunter in his
journal of Transactions in the Colonies. In August
1788, a report was current in the settlement which
for some time appeared credible. It ran thus:&mdash;A
convict named Dailey had discovered a piece of
ground on which was a considerable quantity of
yellow ore. Specimens of the stuff were examined
by the Lieutenant-governor (in the temporary absence
of the Governor), and found to contain several particles
of gold. The convict was interrogated, and so
plausible was his tale that the officials fully believed
it, and doubted not that the man had discovered a
valuable field. He was disinclined to make known
its whereabouts until the Governor's return, when he
promised to give full particulars of the discovery,
provided he and a certain female prisoner should be
liberated and given berths in one of the ships then on
the point of sailing for England. But the Lieutenant-governor,
impatient at the reservation of the convict,
told him that unless the alleged discovery was substantiated
the reward should be of rather a disappointing
and irritating nature. Fearing punishment,
the convict relaxed a little, and said that the mine
was on the lower part of the harbour near the seashore,
and offered to lead the officer to the place.
Accordingly an officer and three or four soldiers
embarked with the discoverer. He took them down
the harbour and landed them near a wood which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
said was only a short distance from the mine. He
led the party into some dense scrub, and when in the
thick of it, managed to give them the slip. The
cheat then made for the camp as quickly as his legs
would take him round the bay, and got back early in
the afternoon. He at once informed the camp
officials that the officer was now in possession of the
gold-mine. Shortly afterwards he sneaked away
from the camp to a place of concealment. Meanwhile
the party in the scrub waited some time for
their guide, and then spent hours in holloing and in
beating the bush for him. At length the officer
decided to return, and as the wily convict had persuaded
him to send back the boat, the party were
obliged to march on foot round to the camp, where
they arrived at dusk, and learned with chagrin of the
trick played upon them. In a few days starvation
brought the convict from his lair. He was promptly
punished for his deceit, although he still asserted the
truth of his story. An officer was again sent with
him to find the mine, and this time the convict was
so frightened at the officer's threat to shoot him if he
attempted to practice another dodge, that he acknowledged
he knew of no mine at all. On being questioned
about the ore produced, the convict confessed
he had filed down part of a yellow metal buckle,
mixed with it some gold filed off a guinea, blended
both with some earth, and made the conglomeration
hard as rock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Munday relates that in 1823 a convict
(one of an ironed gang working on the roads near
Bathurst) was flogged for having in his possession a
lump of rough gold, which the officer in charge
imagined must have been the product of watches or
trinkets stolen and melted down. Indeed, the toiling
prisoners of the early days often picked up bits of
gold, but as they could never find any other than the
first small specimens, their claims for reward were disregarded
and their alleged discoveries disbelieved.
Long before the actual working of the gold-fields
scientific adventurers had predicted the existence of
gold formations in the mountain ranges explored by
them, and geologists who had never visited Australia
had expressed their conviction that the Australian
Cordillera must be auriferous because of the remarkable
similarity of their characteristics and those of
other well-known gold-bearing regions.</p>


<h4>EARLY DISCOVERIES IN NEW SOUTH WALES.</h4>

<p>The honour of making the first report that was
published lies with Count Strzelecki, for in 1839 he
mentioned in the report of his exploration of New
South Wales, under the heading "Gold," of "an
auriferous sulphuret of iron, partly decomposed,
yielding a very small quantity or proportion of gold,
sufficient to attest its presence, insufficient to repay its
extraction." At the request of the Governor, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
afraid of the consequences of awakening the attention
of the colonists and the thousands of convicts
to the presence of the alluring metal, the Count did
not at the time make public his discovery and belief.</p>

<p>Two years later the Rev. W. B. Clarke, an enthusiastic
geologist, who for a long time had been
engaged in the laborious work of studying the
structure of Australia, found gold in the basin of the
Macquarie. He exhibited his specimens to his friends,
to the Government, and also communicated the facts
of his discovery to scientific friends in England.
Subsequent years of exploration increased his conviction
as to the auriferous nature of the mountain
ranges, and at various times from 1842 to 1847 he
published declarations of the existence of gold-fields.
But no one attempted to profit by his disclosures, for
the authorities still considered it unsafe to disturb the
easily excited feelings of the dwellers in the penal
settlement. When Count Strzelecki returned to
England he took with him specimens of the rocks
which he had examined. His theories, together with
those of the Rev. W. B. Clarke, respecting the gold-bearing
nature of the Australian ranges, excited the
attention of Sir Roderick Murchison, and in 1844 this
eminent scientist described to the Royal Geographical
Society the comparison between the formation of the
Australian Cordillera and that of the Ural Mountains,
which he himself had explored between the
years 1841 and 1843. He stated that although no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
gold had been detected in the mountains of Australia,
yet they possessed all the auriferous indications of the
well-known gold-fields of Russia. In 1846 he again
strongly expressed his belief in the richness of the
Australian ranges, and recommended the tin miners
of Cornwall who wanted employment to emigrate to
New South Wales, and there to search for gold
instead of tin.</p>

<p>In addition to the above-named discoveries others
were reported to the Colonial Government; but as it
offered no inducement to a continuance of investigation,
and as the discoverers either deemed it of little
practical importance or lacked the public spirit
necessary for a sustained effort to arouse the colonists,
the "lucky finds" benefited no one but the finders
themselves. A known instance of the latter is that
of an old shepherd named McGregor. He excited a
little temporary curiosity when, laden with "treasure
trove," he travelled by the mail-coach to the metropolis.
After this event subsided the gold-finder was
unheard of for a long time, excepting for the rumour
of his refusing a tempting offer of an enterprising
jeweller as an inducement to disclose the locality
of the treasure ground. But as McGregor "made
money" without any other ostensible means than
that of shepherding and gold-finding, his rise to
wealth may be taken as an evidence of his success in
the latter occupation.</p>

<p>Several stories can be told of these solitary seekers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of the precious metal; but the pursuit was usually
deprecated by men of good standing, for they
believed that on the presence of gold becoming
widely known their own little world would be turned
upside down. Some persons who successfully prosecuted
further researches were pronounced as enemies
to the colony when they dared to disclose the facts
publicly.</p>

<p>But although the clamours of science and enterprise
were silenced for the time, and gold, sent as specimens
of the richness of the country, sceptically
received and even said to be jewels and watches
hidden by thieves and melted by bush fires, yet the
fact of the existence of auriferous ground became
at length so evident that the New South Wales
Executive requested the English Government to send
out an efficient geologist to examine the country.
For this purpose Mr. Sutchbury, an eminent scientist,
left England in September 1850.</p>


<h4>HARGRAVES, THE PIONEER MINER.</h4>

<p>While these discoveries were agitating the minds of
a section of the agricultural and pastoral community,
the one person who by his perseverance and intelligence
initiated the practical working of the gold-fields
of Australia was, like the father of Norval, tending
his flocks and herds, and living quietly as a squatter
near the town of Bathurst. The alternative droughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and floods occurring between the years 1844 and
1848 ruined many Australian settlers, and forced
others to change their mode of life. Edward Hammond
Hargraves was one of these latter unfortunates.
He had been remarkably prosperous before this
disastrous period, and even after it had sufficient to
clear himself from debt. The discovery of rich mines
in California about this time induced him to endeavour
to regain his former fortune by searching for
gold in the valley of the Sacramento. There he
spent nearly two toilsome years seeking the precious
metal. His industry was poorly rewarded. During
summer the life at the diggings was tolerable, but in
the winter the cold was very severe, and Hargraves'
party suffered intensely. Even with every particle of
clothing they possessed heaped upon them they had
extreme difficulty in keeping the warmth in their
bodies whilst sleeping, and in addition to this there
was the danger of the tent being borne down by the
weight of snow upon it, and the risk of being rudely
aroused by the rough paw of any grisly bear that
might take it into his ursine head to leave the
surrounding forest in search of food. The rigours
of the climate, added to their bad luck, so dispirited
the party that at the close of the cold season they
separated. Hargraves, with a heavy heart and a
light pocket, made for San Francisco. All the
hopeful imaginings which had warmed his blood
when he embarked for the gold-country had now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
been entirely dissipated by the grim realities of
mining life.</p>

<p>As he journeyed downwards towards the seaport,
probably whilst reflecting on the vicissitudes of life in
general and of his own in particular, he was struck
with the appearance of a deep gulch in the Sierras,
which awakened old memories, and it dawned upon
him that the features of the surrounding country were
remarkably similar to those of the valleys near his
old home in New South Wales. His two years'
toiling had not weakened his energy nor dulled his
observation, but it had made him more practical. He
examined closely the formation of the surrounding
gold-bearing districts, and found that the rocks and
even the soil corresponded in many respects to the
Blue Mountains of Australia. The many resemblances
between the two places impressed him firmly
with the belief in the existence of a gold-bearing
region in New South Wales.</p>

<p>But his belief did not dissuade him from making
another trial at the Californian diggings. In company
with a friend he made several trips up the
Sacramento, and succeeded in finding some payable
ground; but visions of the secluded valleys near his
old home constantly haunted his mind, while the
rumours he had heard of the finding of treasures in
the recesses of the Blue Mountains vivified his
imaginings and renewed his old desire of retrieving
his fallen fortunes. He disclosed his thoughts to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
mate, and attempted to convince him of the gold-bearing
nature of the hills near Bathurst. But all
the dilations of Hargraves were wasted on his companion,
who expatiated upon the foolishness of
forsaking substantial profits for the sake of shadowy
prospects, and pointed out to the enthusiast that the
geologists of Australia had already searched the
mountains thoroughly, and that if fortunes could
there be made by opening up a gold-field they would
have done so long before. Hargraves argued that
the object of the geologists in examining the ranges
was merely to verify scientific principles, and to
further scientific knowledge; but that to open up a
payable gold-field men of a very different stamp were
needed&mdash;namely, prospectors with a practical knowledge
of the modes of extracting the gold, and with
will and capability to delve with the pick and to
wash the gold-sprinkled earth. Arguments, however,
proved unavailing; therefore Hargraves left
his mate, and all alone shaped his course for New
South Wales.</p>

<p>Hargraves reached Sydney in January 1851. He
called on his former friends, and finding himself
unable to keep silent on the subject that was ever in
his thoughts, he related his experiences in California
and made his propositions; but they were looked
upon as visionary, and when he wished to borrow a
little money in order to carry them out, his request
was coldly received. Of all Hargraves' acquaintances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
only one sympathised in any manner with his enthusiasm,
and not one of them would lend any help
towards working out his schemes. Determined that
his purpose should not be frustrated, Hargraves
resolved, with manly self-reliance, on going alone to
the district that scientists had pronounced to be
auriferous. The few pounds required to buy a horse
and for the expenses on the way he obtained by
promising cent. per cent. interest on the loan, and
repayment of the whole within a few months.</p>

<p>Early in February he set out upon his lonely
journey. Every hour brought before him the old
familiar scenes which reminded him of his former
squatting life. Every step onward quickened his
feelings and increased his hopes of regaining fortune
by bringing him nearer to the Eldorado that was so
rich and bountiful in his imagination.</p>

<p>On the eleventh of the month the solitary horseman
arrived at a small inn on the slope of the Blue
Mountains. He hinted to the lady the object of his
journey. She became interested in the handsome
and travel-stained enthusiast, and at his request
allowed her son to guide him to various creeks in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Hargraves, accompanied
by the boy, left the inn. After a long journey
through the bush they came to Summerhill Creek.
This was the destination of our gold-fields' pioneer.
A good look around confirmed his anticipations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
with glowing feelings he gazed at the realities of
what had haunted him in his visions. Then, in order
to relieve the intense strain which his mind had continuously
endured for the past few months, he lay
quietly down on the banks of the quiet creek. After
a short rest, he took pick and trowel in hand, and
prospected along the water-course. Five panfuls of
earth and gravel were in a short time collected, and
in four of them he found gold. Much elated at this
result, and as the day was now drawing to a close, he
decided to return to the inn and renew his searches
on the morrow.</p>

<p>When he reached the inn he very carefully wrote
an account of his doings and discoveries during the
day, for well he knew that besides being a fortunate
one for himself, the 12th of February 1851 would be
a memorable day in the annals of Australia.</p>

<p>The next day he further examined the creek, and
for the two following months he continued his prospecting
with unflagging industry. His researches
were crowned with indubitable success. He saw
enough of the precious metal to convince him of
the richness of the gold-field, and also discovered
indications of its presence in many surrounding
places. Then, feeling satisfied that the object of
his expedition was accomplished, even beyond his
expectations, he returned to Sydney for the purpose
of obtaining a reward for his discoveries, and making
them known to the public.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The Government of New South Wales received
with suspicion the discoverer's statement that he
could point out a rich gold-field within the boundaries
of the colony. The many pretended gold discoveries
had made them chary of belief in such reports,
besides which the convict element was still a cause
of fear; while, above all, it was thought that the
existence of genuine gold-fields in the Blue Mountains
would long since have been discovered and
made known by the many geologists and other
scientists who had explored the ranges.</p>

<p>But Hargraves was too sensible a man to be
discouraged by the rebuffs of a Conservative Government.
He saw the importance of his discovery, and
by dint of personally interviewing the Colonial Secretary,
he drew from that gentleman a recognition of
it; and with characteristic caution and shrewdness
obtained a guarantee of the Government reward in
the event of its proving valuable. Then he undertook
to disclose the secret to the Government geologist,
and also persuaded persons to accompany him to the
scene of his discoveries. The latter he accomplished
by delivering a lecture at the town of Bathurst, and
by forming companies of miners, to whom he took
upon himself to give a Government authority to dig
for the precious metal. The excitement raised in
the town spread through the surrounding districts,
and very soon numbers of shepherds were allured
from the green pastures unto the "yellow sands."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
This rushing away from the ordinary employments
was expected to entail great losses to the stockholders,
while it was feared by the more timid that
the scenes once enacted at the Californian diggings
would soon be acted over again on these fields.</p>

<p>The Government geologist was in due time despatched
to test the value and importance of the
alleged discoveries. He fully confirmed the truth of
the statements made by Hargraves, and advised the
Government to engage the pioneer to carry out their
measures, because the experience and knowledge in
mining matters which he had acquired in California
would make him specially valuable at the time of the
opening up of fresh diggings.</p>

<p>Before the end of May, one thousand men were on
the spot selected by Hargraves, and the extent and
rich productiveness of the gold-fields had become so
widely known that hundreds flocked daily out of
Sydney. The Government, after some vain efforts
to check this rush, wisely desisted from the attempt,
and proceeded to establish regulations to preserve
good order at the diggings. They issued licenses,
without which it was illegal to dig or search for gold,
and also enforced, with the aid of a body of foot and
mounted police, obedience to the laws.</p>

<p>Hargraves was appointed a Commissioner of
Crown Lands for the purpose of searching, on behalf
of the Government, for further fields of employment
for gold-diggers. In addition to his salary as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Commissioner, he was at once rewarded £500 for his
valuable discoveries; and subsequently, when the
magnitude of their importance had become more
generally realised, this amount was increased by
grants from the New South Wales and Victorian
Governments, and by testimonials from the citizens
of Sydney and Melbourne, to the handsome extent
of £15,000.</p>

<p>Edward Hammond Hargraves was presented to
the Queen in 1853 as the Australian gold discoverer.
The liberal rewards and honours bestowed upon him
are but an infinitesimal portion of the wealth and
fame which have accrued to the colonists through
his discovery. And it is mainly owing to the
thoughtfulness, cleverness, and enterprising perseverance
of Hargraves, that in an extremely short
period Australia has taken an advanced position
among the nations of the world.</p>


<h4>THE ABORIGINAL DISCOVERER.</h4>

<p>The excitement which Hargraves' revelations had
raised abated a little early in June, for the weather
was cold, wet, and inclement, and the digger's life
was thus rendered miserable. The rains flooded the
creeks and drenched the diggers, the floods effectively
preventing all from gold-hunting. Many on
the gold-fields became disheartened, and returned
to Sydney with such gloomy reports that for a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the rush from town was wholly checked. Towards
the close of June, however, a shepherd picked up
gold in the neighbourhood of Turon river. News
of this rapidly spread round the district, and in a
few days hundreds were on the spot hunting greedily
for further treasures.</p>

<p>The next "lucky find" was a magnificent one.
Near the scene of this new rush an aboriginal,
obtaining a brief respite from minding his master's
sheep, took a tomahawk in hand and amused himself
by playing the geologist. He wandered about
chipping the rocks and examining the country
adjacent to the sheep run. A glittering, yellow substance
sticking out of a rock attracted his attention.
Applying his tomahawk, he struck off a portion,
when a lump of the metal so coveted by the white
fellow was revealed to his delighted gaze. The
intelligent black darted away to bring his master
to behold the golden prize. Shortly afterwards he
and his master (Dr. Kerr) arrived at the spot. By
working laboriously with a sledge-hammer, and
breaking the gigantic mass into three pieces, they
managed to disembowel quartz and gold weighing
over two hundredweight. Out of these lumps
the mammoth treasure-trove of one hundred and
sixty pounds of pure gold was obtained, which on
being sold realised the magnificent sum of £4160.</p>

<p>This "Kerr Hundredweight" eclipsed anything
ever previously seen in the shape of nuggets. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
rumour of its dazzling proportions attracted the
notice of adventurers, and increased tenfold the
stream of fortune-hunters that flowed towards the
Turon mines. The district soon became so prosperous,
and the price of land in the vicinity so high,
that land-holders in other districts, fearing a depreciation
in the value of their property, were induced
to offer rewards for discoveries in their own neighbourhood.</p>

<p>But the fame of the New South Wales gold-fields
was short-lived, for greater treasures were a few
months afterwards discovered in Victoria; and the
continued steady yield there put all other discoveries
completely in the shade. The shifting population
of the original diggings at once withdrew from the
tributaries of the Macquarie, and numbers on their
way thither deflected their course on hearing of the
richer auriferous creeks in the neighbouring colony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="alcap">he</span> exodus of gold-seekers from the Port Philip
district to the Sydney side alarmed its leading
men, for they were aware of the necessity of
an increasing population in a rising pastoral community
such as theirs. The agricultural and pastoral
interests were likely to be seriously affected if the
bone and sinew of the labourers sought employment
in the rich mines on the banks of the Turon instead
of on the corn-fields and pasture lands of the Port
Philip district. Besides, the Port Philippians had
for some time been endeavouring to procure separation
from New South Wales; in fact, the act of
separation was just about to take place, and this
stroke of luck in favour of the older colony by
heightening its prospects correspondingly humbled
those of the new colony, and tended to sink it into
insignificance. The Mayor of Melbourne, therefore,
convened a public meeting, at which several energetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and influential men were formed into a Gold Discovery
Committee. This committee, in order to
avert the threatened crisis, offered a reward of two
hundred guineas to the person who should discover a
payable gold-field within the district.</p>


<h4>JAMES ESMOND, THE VICTORIAN PIONEER DIGGER.</h4>

<p>About a month after this meeting in Melbourne
the Geelong newspapers announced the discovery of
gold at Clunes, on the 1st of July, by James Esmond,
a pioneer who does not appear to have heard of the
promised reward.</p>

<p>The adventures of this first of Victorian diggers
were in many respects similar to those of Hargraves.
In 1848 James Esmond was driver of the mail-coach
between Buninyong and Horsham. For
several years he had filled the box-seat, in which
position he received commendation for his careful
handling of the horses, and his courteous behaviour to
his passengers. But at length the dreary monotony
of his long and lonely route through the bush and
over the rocky ranges of the Pyrenees proved too
wearisome for the roving disposition of the young
driver. He therefore threw down the reins and
abandoned his mail contract. Glowing reports of
the golden treasures of California were being circulated
throughout the district, and were listened
to with eager ears by young Esmond. He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
gratify an intense love of adventure that prompted
him to go to the diggings, and at the same time
woo Dame Fortune and win her golden smiles.
Thus he determined, and in due course arrived in
California. He soon experienced the discomforts of
a digger's life, but found very little gold. Ill-luck
attended all his toiling, and made him so thoroughly
disgusted with digging life that he resolved to return
to his old occupation, which, although lacking the
excitement of gold-hunting, was also without its
bitter discouragement and uncertainty. Esmond
returned to Sydney on the ship that brought
Hargraves back to New South Wales. This was
purely by chance, and probably the two men scarcely
ever spoke to each other during the voyage. After
two months spent idly in Sydney he came on to
Melbourne in a very slow sailing vessel, which took
three weeks to make the short voyage between the
two capitals. Esmond journeyed to Buninyong, and
as his old position was occupied by another man,
he was obliged to take to another calling. Nothing
better than bushman's work could be had, so he
undertook to cut down timber and build log-huts
on a station in the Pyrenees. This arduous work
was shared by one companion. In its loneliness
and want of variety it was so directly opposite
to the eventfulness of Esmond's last occupation
that the two men might work for weeks without
seeing another human being. But the dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
uniformity of the lives of the two men was suddenly
changed by the arrival on the scene of a German
geologist named Dr. Bruhn, who showed to
Esmond and his mate rich specimens of gold
found in the neighbourhood, and told the wondering
pair that a practical miner might easily discover a
payable gold-field in the district. This unexpected
announcement immediately filled Esmond with the
desire to once again tempt Dame Fortune. He
easily persuaded his mate to join him in the adventure,
and the pair discontinued tree-felling and hut-building,
and with pick and tin-dish set forth in
search of fortune's golden gifts. As an early poetical
chronicler thus puts it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Behold him, along with his partner, set out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To prospect the unexplor'd ranges about;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They pass the poor natives, crouch'd round their rude fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor linger the beautiful birds to admire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kangaroo furtively peeps from its lair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cunning opossum bestows a wild stare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But till they find gold little rest will they draw."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Esmond and his companion began their prospecting
tour on the 1st of July 1851 (separation day). They
soon attained the object of their expedition, and
with very little effort. On reaching the banks of
Deep Creek, a tributary of the Loddon, they were
gladdened by the sight of glistening quartz. A
little diligent fossicking there was rewarded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
unearthing of a few rich specimens of grain gold,
or what appeared to be such. In order to make sure
of the richness of the metal, Esmond determined
to have the specimen tested by an assayer at
Geelong. On arriving at that town the pureness
of the gold was vouched for, and eager inquiries
were made for the locality where the precious
treasure could be found.</p>

<p>Esmond declined to divulge his secret, and
hastened to obtain the necessary implements and
utensils for working the coveted field. It was the
6th of July before his digging expedition (the first
in Victoria), which consisted of three men besides
himself, was fully equipped. Before leaving Geelong,
Esmond disclosed his destination to the assayer,
who advised other parties fitting out for the Turon
diggings to remain in the district, because of the
probability of richer gold-fields being shortly found
close at hand.</p>

<p>In the meantime another discovery was announced.
A party of six men found sprinklings of gold in the
bed of Anderson's Creek, a tributary of the Yarra,
and only a few miles from Melbourne. These
discoveries were effective in stemming the tide of
emigration to New South Wales. Esmond's field
attracted about thirty men, and produced satisfactory
results until the end of August. It then became
evident that the precious yellow grains were no
longer to be found in the alluvial deposits. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
men at Clunes were getting into severe straits
because of the poorness of the shallow diggings,
when a visitor to the place brought the welcome
news of fresh discoveries and encouraging prospects
for diggers in the neighbourhood of Buninyong.</p>

<p>Amongst the first to leave the Clunes diggings
was Esmond, its original prospector. He joined a
party of nine, who marched over the hills to the
newly-discovered fields. With this party we will
leave the pioneer, for he afterwards worked in company
with others, and met with no extraordinary
adventures. Though remarkably successful as a
digger, he was singularly unfortunate in his speculations.
Subsequently £1000 was voted to him in
reward for his discoveries. He also received a
grant of a piece of land on the site of the first
gold-field.</p>


<h4>OTHER PIONEERS.</h4>

<p>The rich discoveries at Clunes excited the cupidity,
or perhaps we should say the spirit of adventure,
of many of the colonists, and tempted them to leave
their ordinary occupations to join in the search for
gold. A resident of Buninyong, named Thomas
Hiscock, was induced to examine the surrounding
hills. A brief search was rewarded by the discovery,
in one of the many gullies that wind among the
hills, of some bright yellow grains, which, from their
weight and lustre, he thought must be the precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
metal he was in quest of. These specimens he took
to Geelong for the purpose of having them tested
by a competent assayer. He arrived at Geelong
on the 10th of August, and had some difficulty in
finding a reliable gold expert; but a gentleman who
had seen Esmond's specimens a few weeks before
pronounced Hiscock's "find" to be true gold, and
much finer and more glistening than that found at
Clunes. When Hiscock's discovery was made public
a number of workmen and idlers left Geelong and
set out for the gully. But the weather was cold,
and the continual pouring of rain damped the ardour
of most of the adventurers ere they began to seek
for the precious metal. Many remained in the
township of Buninyong, not venturing to camp on
the hills, because the ground there was so muddy
and the gully so slushy as to render living under
canvas extremely miserable, and fossicking for gold
almost impossible. Despite these drawbacks there
were within a fortnight of the arrival of its discoverer
in Geelong over forty diggers at work in Hiscock's
gully. But ill-luck attended the efforts of most of
these pioneers, and continual disappointments forced
many of them to try the diggings at Clunes.</p>

<p>With this object in view, a digger named Dunlop
packed up his tent and baggage, and would have
taken himself to Clunes; but when he learned that
four pounds was the price of carriage in the waggon
about to start for that place, he resolved to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Buninyong another trial. Early next morning he
disappeared from the township. In the evening
he returned to his wondering mate and showed
him a match-box containing half an ounce of gold,
which he said was the result of that day's seeking
amongst the hills five or six miles away. His
mate would not believe his tale, but at break of
day Dunlop again disappeared&mdash;this time in company
with a friend named Regan. A few days
elapsed, and the two men being still away, his mate
went out in search of them. Then the absence of
the three men was remarked at the hotel where
they had been lodging. Four other men, suspecting
the cause of the sudden disappearance, and hoping
to share in any fresh discoveries, went stealthily
out of the township and endeavoured to track the
supposed lucky prospectors. But the latter did
not wish to be discovered, and attempted to elude
their pursuers. However, all their efforts to escape
observation were in vain, for in a very short time
the place that Dunlop had discovered attracted
almost all the diggers from Buninyong, who soon
displaced the few miserable native wanderers who
had roamed over Poverty Flat&mdash;as it was gruesomely
named&mdash;"monarchs of all they surveyed, and lords
of the fowl and the brute."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the treasures of Golden Point
were revealed. A family named Cavanagh had
secured a half-worked claim, and having carried it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
below a layer of pipe-clay into the midst of some
decayed slate, they struck the first of those rich
pockets which were afterwards found in such
abundance throughout the Golden Point Field.</p>

<p>Before the end of August the mineral richness
of the neighbouring creeks became evident, and
numbers of nimble fossickers gathered the first
crops of the Ballarat gold-fields. In September
rich diggings were opened at Mount Alexander,
and two or three weeks later the yield of those at
Bendigo eclipsed for a time the glories of all other
fields.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="alcap">he</span> wonderful effect of the valuable discoveries
made during the first few months of gold-seeking
soon became apparent in Melbourne and Geelong,
owing to the rapid departure for the diggings
of great numbers of the townsfolks, who abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
their ordinary vocations in order to get a share of
the profuse rewards there meted out by Mother
Earth to the industrious or the lucky.</p>

<p>The Victorian population at this time was only
77,000, of which 30,000 were concentrated in the two
principal towns. Nearly all these people became
mad for gold. The whole of the colony was stirred
to its inmost depths, and underwent a total revolution
in all its social relations.</p>

<p>Almost the first manifestation of the change was
shown in the sudden appearance of an immense
motley throng upon the roads that converged to the
gold-fields. Thousands of men of every walk in life&mdash;rich
and poor, old and young, sturdy and weak&mdash;were
enticed from the comforts and delights of the
domestic hearth, and from the conveniences and
amusements of town life, by the allurements of the
glittering prizes which Dame Fortune was lavishly
dealing out to the pioneer prospectors, and which
seemed to dangle before the expectant eyes of everyone.
What a strange and entertaining sight the
thickly-thronged roads must have presented to the
observant student of human nature! Many a tramp
hopefully toiling along with swag on back; bands of
mechanics with lumbering drays and bony nags to
assist in transporting the heavy necessaries; parties
with light hand-carts and wheel-barrows energetically
pushing and pulling their primitive vehicles; shopmen
in spring carts; doctors and lawyers in first-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
gigs and buggies. The whole of these, from beggar
to barrister, from pickpocket to parson, were to be
seen hieing along dusty roads and journeying through
hitherto untrodden forest, all impelled by the one
covetous desire to the one end&mdash;the gold-fields,
where, perchance, they might reap a golden harvest
without the laborious years of working and the
wearisomeness of waiting, which are the usual checks
to success in other pursuits.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">The Rush to the Diggings.</p>
</div>

<p>Ere these fortune-hunters reached the Eldorado
of their wishes, many obstacles had to be overcome.
The roughness of the road, the yielding nature of the
bush tracks, and general unevenness of the ground,
occasioned many a poor horse to knock under and
leave his master or masters in a sorry plight. Their
fellow-wayfarers seeing such a predicament would
sometimes lend a helping hand; and it was not
uncommon to see thirty or forty men dragging a
dray up some of the steep hills by means of ropes,
or carrying on their backs portions of a heavy load.</p>

<p>A number of the travellers were free and independent.
These, carrying all their property with
them, usually made a day's journey of about twenty
miles; then, after an <i>al-fresco</i> meal, they lay down
in the open-air, with their blankets wrapped like
martial cloaks around them, and were lulled to
sleep by the breezy murmurs of the wild bush.
Others, ignorant of the obstacles they had to
encounter, rushed away from town insufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
supplied with provisions, and the few public-houses
on the way became quickly packed to confusion by
these half-famished wanderers, demanding food and
drink.</p>

<p>Many of the first arrivals on the fields soon found
out that the life of a digger was not all honey,
and, after a few bitter experiences, either went back
to their old employments in the town, or adapted
themselves to the requirements of the new order of
things by supplying the diggers' camp with provisions&mdash;an
occupation which was generally quite as lucrative
as that of the average digger. Meanwhile, the fame
of the Victorian gold-fields had circulated throughout
the adjacent colonies. Very soon the tide of
emigration was turned from the Turon mines, and
flowed in the direction of Ballarat and its vicinity.
It poured into the auriferous creeks in the shape of
an immense living mass, every unit big with expectation,
and bent on ferreting out and appropriating
some fragment of the golden lodestone.</p>

<p>The bush surrounding the diggings was quickly
thinned of its timber&mdash;its red gum, stringy bark,
and box trees serving as good fuel for the culinary
fire of the digger. Even the tallest and most
massive giants of the forest were not spared, and
soon the scene was completely shorn of its pristine
sylvan beauty. Verdant hillocks and grassy mounds,
which in primeval days had been the peaceful browsing
and grazing grounds of the kangaroo and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
species, and the happy hunting grounds of their
scarcely human enemy, the aboriginal black, were
speedily changed into yellow-coloured upheavals,
which from a distance presented to the interested
spectator the lively appearance of great ant-hills
warming with busy workers, who now dropped into
pits cut in the slopes, and anon reappeared bearing
heavy loads, with which they impetuously rushed to
the turbid waters of the nearest gully.</p>

<p>On the diggings everyone was subjected to the
sway of the golden metal, and the effect of the
spell on the different temperaments was as interesting
as they were varied. In some of the diggers
the sympathetic springs of life's action seemed to
be completely clogged; the demon of avarice held
complete dominion, and rendered these men forgetful
of the commonest offices of humanity. But over
others the spell was not so potent, or its sordid
effect so marked&mdash;an occasional pausing or ceasing
from work in order to exchange civilities, or to do
a friendly action, betokening that a desire for the
amenities of life was not entirely obliterated even
among the rough hairy diggers in their most cupiditative
pursuit.</p>

<p>A year later the fame of the enormous yield of
the Victorian gold-fields had astonished the whole
world, and quickly attracted numerous ship-loads of
emigrants from every centre of civilisation. This
great influx set in about September 1852, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
doubled the population before the end of the year.
During 1852 and 1853 Victoria became the most
populous of the colonies by the arrival of nearly
200,000 persons, the arrivals in Hobson's Bay
averaging about 1800 weekly.</p>

<p>Many of the more sober-minded of the colonists
were greatly concerned in mind by this tremendous
inundation; but the go-ahead or hopefully-inclined
trusted that the great successive waves of fresh
inhabitants from the thickly-populated portions of
the old world would be the making of the colony.
The influx was certainly an immediate boon to the
sheep-farmers of the period. The state of the colony
in the early days was well described by London
<i>Punch</i> in the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The land of the South that lies under our feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deficient in mouths, over-burdened with meat."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But now the order of things was reversed, and, owing
to the ever-increasing number of mouths to be fed,
the prices of all articles of consumption went up
enormously.</p>


<h4>CANVAS TOWN.</h4>

<p>House accommodation became wholly inadequate
to meet the requirements of the great multitude, and
holders of tenements made enormous profits by
letting portions of their mean dwellings at extraordinary
high rents. Many respectable and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
monied persons were obliged to live in tents, while
large numbers passed both day and night with no
other roof than the blue sky overhead.</p>

<p>A unique suburb sprang into existence on the
south side of the Yarra. It was improvised by the
surplus population who could not obtain shelter in
over-crowded Melbourne. Its name&mdash;Canvas Town&mdash;describes
its construction. It was pleasantly situated,
commencing on a grassy slope, and was laid
out in streets and lanes; the principal thoroughfares
being crowded with boarding-houses and shops, all
of canvas. The Government charged the occupant
of each impromptu dwelling five shillings per week
for the right to camp on the site. All sorts of people
mingled together in this primitive township, and
many new chums here took their first lessons in
roughing it.</p>


<h4>RAG FAIR.</h4>

<p>Another novel and interesting scene was the
market which sprang into existence on the wharf
where most of the arrivals landed. The exorbitant
rates charged for cart-hire and store-rent precluded
many from removing their heavy luggage, which
remained day after day piled up in huge heaps by
the water-side. At length some of the emigrants
devised a plan for its sale. An impromptu bazaar
was opened; the sea-chests were placed back to
back, and arrayed in lines with the up-turned lids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
strewed with the contents, so that the merchandise
was fully exposed for inspection. A brisk trade
soon sprang up, in which abundance of wearing
apparel and household furniture was sold at "alarming
sacrifices," as the exigencies of the times
demanded the immediate disposal of all cumbrous
articles. The low prices increased the popularity of
this "Rag Fair," as it was called, and the business
became at last so considerable that, in response to
the complaints of shopkeepers, the City Council
issued an order for its stoppage.</p>

<p>In striking contrast to the efforts made by these
new chums in getting rid of their superfluities in
order to buy a suitable outfit for the diggings, were
the dissipations and freaks of many returned diggers,
who, having been lucky on the gold-fields, were now
recklessly squandering their quickly-acquired wealth.
These extravagant displays tended to quicken the
movements of new arrivals in their preparations, and
to keep up a constant flowing of the population
between the rich diggings and the town.</p>


<h4>NEW CHUMS AND OLD CHUMS.</h4>

<p>The picturesqueness of life on the gold-fields was
heightened by the appearance on the scene of the
immigrants, who brought with them the many
peculiarities of their national traits. The bluff
Englishman and the mirthful Irishman, the cautious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Scotchman and the volatile Frenchman, the industrious
German and the 'cute Yankee&mdash;all could be
seen working in close proximity; while the indefatigable
Chinaman toiling close at hand, generally
in claims abandoned by his more robust European
neighbours, added not a little to the varied attraction
of the scene.</p>

<p>These representatives of different nationalities
brought with them their own distinctive notions of
rights and freedom; but their common occupation
and necessary intercourse modified many objectionable
peculiarities. Differences of class, too, were laid
aside; the illiterate labourer ranked on the same
footing as the scholarly adventurer, provided they
both possessed a strong arm and a stout heart. In
short, the motley throng on the gold-field formed a
vast republic of labour.</p>

<p>The general greeting to men of aristocratic birth
or manners was superciliously conveyed by the title
of "swell," "genteel cove," or the slang term "Joe."
These gentlemen-diggers being mostly unfit for
roughing it, were sometimes engaged by the lords
of labour to light the fires and wash tin-plates and
pannikins. Of course this reversion of the usual
order of things had an inflatory effect on the common
labourers, whose superior bone and sinew made them
for the time the better men. As an instance of it,
we quote from McCombie:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A squatter had come to the diggings to hire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
shearers, and seeing a party of men who seemed to
be idle, he asked if they would engage for the sheep-shearing.
After a little hesitation one of the party
replied that they would if they had their own terms.
On being asked to state them, he replied, in a
bantering tone, <i>the wool upon their backs</i>. The
squatter turned away, but was soon recalled. He
quickly obeyed the summons, supposing the men
had thought better of his offer. The spokesman
of the party now told, with a knowing leer,
that his mates and himself were in want of a <i>cook</i>,
and they had come to the resolution to offer him a
pound a day if he would condescend to accept the
office."</p>

<p>Again, the appearance of anything like fine
manners or "swell" clothes was instantly reprobated.
Innocent offenders in these respects were quickly
reminded of the incongruity between Continental
and Victorian ceremonies and fashions. New chums
frequently presented themselves on the diggings
clothed in London or Paris costumes, and thus
advertised, they were welcomed with noisy merriment,
and at once named "Joeys" amidst ironical
cheers. An anecdote of this nature follows; it is
extracted from <i>Glimpses of Life in Victoria</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A very pleasant, gentlemanly young fellow, lately
arrived, and inexperienced in the customs of the
colony, ventured one day among the diggings
wearing the conspicuous tall hat which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
always been used to wear at home. He was
instantly assailed by cries of 'Joe! Joe!' which
were re-echoed on every side and reiterated by
hundreds of voices, as one man after another popped
up his head from the hole in which he was working
and joined in the mocking chorus. Quite unconscious
that he was the observed of all eyes, he
walked unsuspectingly on, but the clamour still
increased, and many a finger pointed at him at
length caused him to guess pretty correctly the
cause of the commotion. He had much ready wit
and self-possession, and did not deliberate long on
the course to pursue, but taking off his hat he turned
from side to side and made a series of profound
bows to the noisy community. The effect was all
that he could have desired, for the piercing shouts
were presently exchanged for a hearty cheer, and
he was suffered to continue his way unmolested."</p>

<p>From what has been said it may be gathered
that in the early muscular days of the colony work
made the man, and want of it the fellow. The
feeble-bodied digger was nowhere in the race for
wealth, and many a solitary sickly one dropped out
of existence unknown to any of his friends, and not
even missed in the ever-varying excitements of the
times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="alcap">uring</span> the hours of relaxation the proceedings
on the diggings contrasted vividly with the
day's employment. The end of the day's labours
was in the early days announced by the firing of a
gun from the tent of the Commissioner. Then
followed a general abandonment of the chip, chip of
the pick against the rock, the delving in the mud, the
barrow-wheeling, the cradle-rocking, and the puddling
in clayey water-holes. With mud-bespattered shirt,
clay-soiled pants, and heavy yellow-stained boots,
each digging-party sought its tent. Then the ringing
sound of axes wielded by brawny arms told of
preparations for the evening meal. Hundreds of
thin lines of blue smoke ascending from as many
fires joined to make the large volume that wafted
overhead. Soon the singing of the kettles on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
blazing logs cheered the weary digger with the
prospect of a fragrant pannikin of tea to moisten his
damper&mdash;a somewhat heavy staff of life, but one
admirably adapted to support the toiling gold-seeker.</p>

</div>

<p>Refreshed and stimulated by the evening meal, the
diggers would then light their pipes, and soon the
curling wreaths of smoke circling round betokened
the complacency of the different companies. Then
yarns were spun, arguments held, and songs sung,
until the loquacious and musical ones became
exhausted or the listeners had fallen asleep.</p>


<h4>SLY GROG SHANTIES.</h4>

<p>But the harmony of such scenes was but too often
disturbed by the noise of drunken revelry&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sottish sets more opulent than wise,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In hurtful stimulants and risky games."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Although selling intoxicating liquors was an illegal
offence on the first gold-fields, yet, despite the
vigilance of the Commissioners, the votaries of
Bacchus were supplied with their spirituous comforts
by certain storekeepers, who cunningly contrived to
conceal the illicit decoctions and carry on a brisk
trade on the sly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The ingenuity of these sly grog-sellers in baffling
the police evoked a corresponding sharpness on the
part of the Commissioners in detecting illegal
practices. When a plant was discovered its contents
were either confiscated or wasted, and its owner,
if found, was visited with the full wrath of the
authorities, and afterwards punished according to the
law.</p>

<p>An instance of the summary manner in which
some cases were dealt with is here inserted from
<i>Glimpses of Life in Victoria</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We stopped next before an empty tent of ample
dimensions, which appeared to court the light of day,
for it was half-open, and its interior was unusually
neat and clean. A heap of digging implements lay
in front, and a pair of moleskin trousers were hung
artlessly over the top of the tent (Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s
informant had bidden him to take notice of a tent
so decorated). Inside, at the furthest end, stood a
large-sized bedstead, white and clean to outward
appearance, with a deep valance running round the
foot. Nothing in the least suspicious was visible in
this neat open dwelling; nevertheless, it was to the
pure white couch that Mr. &mdash;&mdash;-, having dismounted,
marched straight up through the opening of the tent,
with the order that it should be searched forthwith.
The valance was lifted and disclosed a large quarter
cask and several kegs full of rum, which were taken
up and deposited outside. 'Who is the owner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
this tent?' demanded Mr. &mdash;&mdash; again of the crowd
which had gathered around him. The question was
repeated, but it fell, as before, on a silent assembly.</p>

<p>"'Since this property has no owner,' said he, 'I will
quickly show you what I will do with it.'</p>

<p>"Catching hold of a pick that was lying at hand, he
set to work himself to remove the top of the cask,
then dipping a bucket into the liquor, he soused the
tent inside and out; the kegs were emptied out in
like manner, till the whole of the hoarded store was
spilt, and the air was reeking with the smell of rum.
Then striking a match, he applied it to the ground,
and the spirit igniting set fire to the tent, which
flared and blazed up in a moment, throwing a ruddy
glow over the throng of angry faces that looked on in
gloomy silence, broken only by a half-smothered
imprecation from some of the most daring of the
crowd. The flames arose higher and higher, when
suddenly a gun went off, producing for the moment
an effect which might truly be called sensational.
No one knew whence the discharge had come,
whether some hand in the angry crowd had fired it,
and whether others might follow; presently, however,
it was ascertained that the gun had been in the tent,
and that the fire had caused it to explode. 'We had
better move off,' said a voice; 'there might be more
guns yet in that tent.'</p>

<p>"As might be expected, such proceedings were
viewed by a certain class of diggers with anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
but satisfaction. Cries of 'It's a &mdash;&mdash; shame,' and
'Don't waste the &mdash;&mdash; grog,' evinced the boiling
feelings of the rougher element. Even the lovers of
order were generally mortified by the restrictions of
the liquor laws."</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="alcap">nother</span> and greater grievance which daily
stirred up strife between the diggers and the
Commissioners was the gold-digger's license. The
collecting of the license fee was from the first an
invidious duty, which demanded a vast deal of tact on
the part of the Commissioners and staff, for the
diggers were always opposed to the tax, and many
were the ruses they adopted to escape its payment.</p>

<p>The first skirmish in connection with this impost
took place at the Golden Point, Ballarat. The
diggers at the Point understood that no tax would
be charged for the month of September 1852, as the
Government wished to encourage prospecting on new
gold-fields. But the Commissioners, on arriving at
Golden Point, perceived by the general appearance of
cheerfulness that the field was yielding good returns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Yet the diggers gave most evasive answers to their
inquiries as to the result of the prospecting, and
reminded them that the Government would forego
the September tax. These artifices led the Commissioners
to suspect that the men on the Point were
more than ordinarily successful, and were planting
their gains out of the range of the official eye. But
an old pioneer named Connor failed to hide a
pannikin full of gold dust, and its discovery confirming
the suspicions of the Commissioners, they
concluded that the community was prosperous
enough to pay the tax, and thereupon announced
that a license fee of fifteen shillings must be paid for
the latter half of the month.</p>

<p>This proclamation aroused the indignation of the
diggers. They held a meeting, at which a man
named Swindells mounted the "stump," and denounced
the sharp conduct of the officials. A
deputation of two (the orator and a Mr. Oddie)
were appointed to interview the Commissioners, in
order to get them to revoke their decision. This the
Commissioners bluntly refused to do, and the two
representatives, after a wordy war, were compelled to
retreat. The diggers now became exasperated, and
when they further heard that Connor, the man whose
carelessness was the immediate cause of the levying
of the tax, had actually paid it, their wrath knew no
bounds. They bonnetted him, pelted him with mud
till he was almost covered, and would have proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to greater indignities had not Oddie and a few others
curbed their unbridled feelings by referring to the
grey hairs of the delinquent.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this heated manifestation of ill-temper,
the Commissioners enforced the license fee,
and it was noticed, as is very often the case in
popular demonstrations, that many of the most
violent of the diggers succumbed the readiest under
official pressure. But the last to give in was
Swindells, so that when he did apply for a license his
consistent obnoxiousness was remembered by the
Commissioners to his disadvantage, and they refused
to grant him one.</p>

<p>To recompense him the diggers, therefore, subscribed
and presented him with 12 ounces of gold for
his efforts on their behalf. Swindells afterwards
went to Forest Creek diggings, and as a report came
to the Point that a license was again denied him, the
diggers asserted that the Government had determined
to put a stop to his mining in Victoria because he
had championed their cause at Ballarat.</p>

<p>On first hearing of the gold discoveries the
Executive of Victoria had exercised their prerogative,
as representatives of the Crown, to claim all precious
metals found within the colony. A notice was issued
forbidding anyone to dig for gold unless under
certain rules, one of which was that the gold-seeker
should pay a license fee of 30s. per month before
commencing his search.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>The colony, which was then in its infancy, was
governed according to the Crown Colony system;
but by the incessant arrivals its population so
increased in numerical strength as to be almost
beyond the control of the ruling powers. The
Government appear to have been particularly puzzled
as to their duties towards the vast irregular society
upon the gold-fields. That it should be regarded as
merely a migratory flight of population from the old
centres of civilisation, which having swooped down
upon the gold sown broadcast in the land, would
presently return whither it came, carrying away the
best of the gold harvest, was the idea which must
have occupied the minds of the authorities, for they
never attempted to make the gold-fields' population
a part of the colony until the clamouring of the
insurrectionists at Ballarat dispelled the illusion, and
apprised them of the impolicy of delay in according
a social status to the gold-digger.</p>

<p>The Executive of the day sought to solve the
difficulty by the appointment of Police Magistrates
or Commissioners, whose chief duty seems to have
been the enforcement of the gold-tax act.</p>

<p>Now in the digging community were many factious
adventurers, whose peculiar ideas of rights and
liberties would have clashed with any form of
government. These malcontents exasperated the
Commissioners, and caused the power lodged in them
to be used in its fullest extent. The police force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
were directed to keep continual watch on the fields,
and compel the production of licenses as often as
they pleased to ask for them. Even the prudent
exercise of this authority would no doubt have been
galling to law-abiding miners, for tax-paying, without
the surveillance, is not as a rule congenial to the
feelings of members of settled communities.</p>

<p>But the majority of the police officers were
generally overbearing and insolent, and their want
of tact when dealing with the rough natures on the
diggings greatly increased the embarrassment of
affairs. A license-hunt was the name among the
diggers for the collecting of the tax&mdash;the police being
the hounds, while many a digger in his wily attempt
to escape payment proved himself a veritable fox in
cunning.</p>


<h4>DIGGER-HUNTING ANECDOTES.</h4>

<p>The following vigorous descriptions of this tax-collecting
graphically portray the feelings of both
diggers and officials. The first is extracted from
Kelly's entertaining <i>Life in Victoria</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"W&mdash;&mdash;n shouted down, 'Come up, boys&mdash;come
along, quick; the game is started!' and as I was being
hoisted up I heard the swelling uproar and the loud
chorus of 'Joes' from every side. As I gained the
surface everybody was in commotion&mdash;diggers with
their licenses lowering down their mates without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
them; others, with folded arms, cursing the system
and damning the Government; some stealing away
like hares when hounds are in the neighbourhood;
and several 'tally-ho'd,' bursting from points where
they could escape arrest, while 'Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!
Joe! Joe!' resounded on all sides; the half-clad
Amazons running up the hill-sides, like so many
bearers of the 'fiery cross,' to spread to the neighbouring
gullies the commencement of the police
foray. The police, acting on a preconcerted plan of
attack, kept closing in upon their prey; the mounted
portion, under the commander-in-chief, occupying
commanding positions on the elevated ranges to
intercept escape or retreat. A strong body of the
foot force, fully armed, swept down the gully in
extended line, attended by a corps of light infantry
traps in loose attire, like greyhounds in the slip, ready
to rush from the leash as the quarry started. But the
orders of the officers could not be heard from the
loud and continuous roars of 'Joe! Joe! Joe!'&mdash;'Curse
the Government!&mdash;the beaks, the traps,
commissioners, and all'&mdash;'the robbers,'&mdash;'the bushrangers,'
and every other vile epithet that could be
remembered, almost into their ears. At length the
excitement got perfectly wild as a smart fellow,
closely pursued by the men-hounds, took a line of
the gulley cut up with yawning holes, from which the
cross planks had been purposely removed; every
extraordinary spring just carrying him beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
grasp of capture, his tracks being filled the instant he
left them, and the outstretched arm of the trap within
an inch of seizure in the following leap. I myself
was strangely inoculated with the nervous quiver of
excitement, and I think I gave an involuntary cheer
as the game and mettle of the digger began to tell.
But there arose a terrific menacing outcry of 'Shame!
shame!&mdash;treachery!&mdash;meanness!' which a glance in
the direction of the general gaze showed me was
caused by a charge of the mounted men on the high
ground to head back the poor fugitive. I really
thought a conflict would have ensued, for there was a
mad rush to the point where the collision was likely
to take place, and fierce vows of vengeance registered
by many a stalwart fellow who bounded past me to
join in the fray. A moment after the mounted men
wheeled at a sharp angle, and a fresh shout arose as
another smart young fellow flew before them with
almost supernatural fleetness, like a fresh hare started
as the hunted one was on the point of being run
down. I marvelled to see him keep the unbroken
ground with the gulley at his side impracticable for
cavalry; but no, he made straight on for a bunch of
tents with a speed I never saw equalled by a
pedestrian. It was even betting, too, that he would
have reached the screen first, when lo! he stopped
short so suddenly as only just to escape being ridden
down by the Commissioner&mdash;the Cardigan of the
charge&mdash;who seized him by the shirt collar in passing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
The rush of diggers now became diverted to the
scene of caption. I hurried forward there too,
although fearing I should witness the shedding of
blood and the sacrifice of human life; but as I
approached I was agreeably disappointed at hearing
loud roars of laughter, and jeering outbursts of 'Joe!
Joe!' amidst which the crowd opened out a passage
for the crest-fallen heroes, who rode away under such
a salute of opprobrious epithets as I never heard
before, for the young fellow who led them off the idle
chase stopped short the moment he saw the real
fugitive was safe, coolly inquiring of his captor 'what
crime he was guilty of to be hunted like a felon.'
'Your license, you scoundrel!' was the curt reply.
Upon which he put his hand in his pocket and pulled
out the document, to the ineffable disgust of their
high mightinesses, who in grasping at the shadow had
lost the substance.</p>

<p>"It was a capital ruse, adopted in an emergency,
and played with greater skill than if there had been
a regular rehearsal. I flatter myself that I am a
loyal man on the average, and a respectable upholder
of law and order; but I was unable to repress an
emotion of gratification at the result of the chase, or
an impulse of hero worship, as I sought the sole actor
in the successful diversion to offer my congratulations.
The myrmidons of the law now moved up
the middle of the gully in close order, attended by
anything but an admiring cortége, who made it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
point never to let the cry of 'Joe! Joe!' subside for
a moment. Occasionally a license was demanded,
and its production was the signal for fresh outbursts
of the tumult; but the 'license meet' was brought to
a close by two other successful feints that were
played off by a pair of diggers, who simulated a
guilty timidity and dropped themselves in a slide
down their ropes into the bottoms of their wet holes,
followed by a brace of traps with dashing gallantry,
who chased them into the muddy drives, where the
lurkers purposely crawled to lead their pursuers
into the muck. Of course they were hauled up in
triumph, but the hallelujahs were quickly superseded
by choking screams of 'Joe! Joe!' when the
prisoners produced their digging warrants. The
Commissioner did not venture on another 'throw off,'
but moved away sullenly with his forces to the tune
of 'Joe! Joe! Joe!' and expressions of regret 'that
he would have to drink the Royal Family's health
after dinner at his own expense,' and such-like
observations."</p>

<p>Another aspect of the digger-hunting process is
given by Mr. R. M. Sergeant, correspondent of the
<i>Geelong Advertiser</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Traps! traps! Joe! Joe!' were the well-known
signals which announced that the police were out
on a license raid. The hasty abandonment of tubs
and cradles by fossickers and outsiders, and the great
rush of shepherds to the deep holes on the flat as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
police hove in view, readily told that there were not
a few among them who believed in the doctrine that
'base is the slave who pays.' Hunting the digger
was evidently regarded by Commissioner Sleuth and
his hounds as a source of delightful recreation, and
one of such paramount importance to the State that
the sport was reduced to an exact science. Thus,
giving a couple of dirty constables in diggers' disguise
jumping a claim, the gentle shepherd approaches, with
dilapidated shovel on shoulder, and proceeds to dispossess
intruders in a summary manner. A great
barney ensues. The constable and his mate talk big,
a crowd gathers round, and 'A ring! a ring!' is the
cry. The combatants have just commenced to shape
when the signal referred to at the head of this paragraph
rings through the flat. On come the traps in
skirmishing order, driving in the stragglers as they
advance, and supported by mounted troopers in the
rear, who occupy commanding positions in the
ranges. A great haul is made, and some sixty
prisoners are marched off in triumph to the camp,
handcuffed together like a lot of felons, there to be
dealt with according to the caprice or cupidity of their
pursuers."</p>

<p>Raffello, in his history of the Ballarat riot, says:&mdash;"At
the shouting of 'Joe! Joe!' the diggers without
licenses make for the deep shaft, and leave a licensed
mate or two at the windlass. The diggers were
besieged by a regiment of troopers, and traps under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
their protection would venture into the holes. The
sight of the rich-looking washing stuff in possession
of some lucky diggers aroused the cupidity of the
police, and often made them blind to the condition of
the unfortunate ones. Some of the traps were civil
enough, and felt the shame of the duty, but others
enjoyed the fun. The authorities generally treated
the diggers very harshly. Troopers would scour the
neighbouring bush, and all the unfortunate diggers
they captured were tied to the stumps of trees, and
left there until the hunt was over, when the captives
were collected and taken to the depôt which the traps
established in order to bring together the whole of
their victims. From there the batch of prisoners were
marched off to the camp, and fined £5, or imprisoned.
So much for the unlicensed digger. The digger who
wished to obtain a license was obliged to travel a few
miles, and then was often kept waiting at the Commissioner's
tent for two or three hours."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>



<hr class="c65" />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="chsub"><i>BEGINNINGS OF REVOLT.</i></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="alcap">he</span> arbitrary conduct on the part of the officials
became at length intolerable. A change in
the social organisation on the gold-fields, which was
visible in 1853, enabled the diggers to agitate
systematically for the repeal of the license fee.
During the first two years of gold-seeking in Victoria
the fields were thronged with diggers, who, like
adventurous birds of passage, came expecting to pick
up treasures in rich lumps, and return at once with
a fortune. Many realised their hopes, and others,
meeting with discouragements, abandoned the pursuit,
so that gold-mining became an occupation followed
by men as a settled means of earning a livelihood.
Then the bitter feelings against the "exorbitant"
license fee were shown in grim earnest.</p>

<p>An outbreak occurred on the Ovens in January
1853, in which an Assistant Commissioner was
roughly handled by the diggers. In May, at Forest
Creek, a disturbance arose, owing to the unjust action
(so the diggers said) of a trooper, and it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
quelled until the military and police were called out
to restore order. Great indignation meetings were
held at Bendigo, a few months later, to call attention
to the continued mismanagement of the gold-fields,
and almost simultaneously the Ballarat miners commenced
their demonstrations of war against the
license fee.</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction and discontent prevailed nearly
everywhere; still the Commissioners did not relax
their obnoxious compulsory means of collecting the
tax. The persistency of the officials' harshness, and
the conduct of the Government in upholding it, were
taken by many diggers as indications of their being
regarded as a despicable portion of the population.
But this idea was dispelled for a time, when it became
known that the Governor of the colony intended to
visit the gold-fields.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Hotham made the promised tour about
the middle of 1854, and in spite of existing grievances
he was most cordially received everywhere.
An amusing episode of his visit is described by Mr.
W. Kelly as follows:&mdash;</p>


<h4>AN IRISH GALLANT.</h4>

<p>"As soon as the modest cortége of the vice-regal
party was discerned by the expectant diggers, there
arose a loud shout of welcome, which was echoed
and re-echoed from hill and glen, from flat and gully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
until all Ballarat was one wild hurrah of rejoicing.
The first impulse of the people was to detach the
horses from the carriage and draw it themselves, but
against this proceeding Sir Charles protested with
complimentary tact, to the effect that he wished to
see people more suitably employed than as beasts
of burden. The sentiment was duly appreciated and
responded to by a genuine cheer, a Milesian giant&mdash;the
leader of the multitude&mdash;at the same time
thrusting his arm into the carriage and shaking his
Excellency lustily by the hand. Sir Charles then
requested his Irish friend to direct the carriage
towards some of the best of the adjacent gullies,
and when it had proceeded as far as the horses
could find firm footing, both he and Lady Hotham
descended, while every hat, cap, and caubeen in the
crowd ascended on the wings of a roar of ecstasy.
Sir Charles took his lady on his arm, having a large
crook-headed stick in the opposite hand, but of this
his Milesian friend very quickly and unceremoniously
deprived him to keep a lane open for their advance,
addressing humorous apostrophes to the people and
their distinguished visitors, which relieved the procession
of all dullness and formality; and on coming
to a muddy space where the path was too miry to
walk over, having no cloak or coat to throw under
her footsteps, like a courtly knight of yore, he
caught up Lady Hotham bodily, with true impulsive
gallantry, and seating her on his shoulder, carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
her across amidst a tumult of admiration quite
impossible to describe.</p>

<p>"Come to Canadian Gully, buckets of rich washing-stuff
were hoisted up from the claim, and examined
by Sir Charles, who was astonished at seeing numerous
golden particles in the dirt. One fine nugget
challenged particular observation, and this Pat picked
out with his fingers, and presented in a most gracious
manner to Lady Hotham, although he had no interest
whatever in the claim. The operation of puddling
and cradling was gone through, to the great satisfaction
of the vice-regal pair, who expressed their
warm thanks, Sir Charles emphatically asking, 'What
can I do for you, my friends, in return for your
kindness?' whereupon the ready-witted Celt, bowing
respectfully, impressively replied, 'Abolish the license
tax.' This was the signal for renewed cheering; and
as there was an expressed anxiety to have a reply,
Sir Charles informed the multitude that if they would
accompany him to the camp, where he intended to
address them, they would learn his sentiments on
the matter.</p>

<p>"Well, they did accompany him, and listened with
evident satisfaction to the deliberate expressions of
their Governor on that occasion. After making a
tour of the gold-fields, the Governor parted with the
diggers on the best possible terms."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>


<h4>REFORM LEAGUES.</h4>

<p>Meanwhile the Government maintained the licensing
in its fullest extent. In October 1854 the police
received orders to go out twice a-week in search of
unlicensed diggers. There were then four Commissioners
at Ballarat, between whom the superintendence
of the surrounding gold-fields was divided,
but so ill-defined were the boundaries of each district
that the police in their raids went over the same
ground more than once, and thus unnecessarily
roused the anger of the diggers by repeatedly bailing
up a "mate," or by compelling the production of a
license over and over again on the same day.</p>

<p>These stringent measures of the authorities served
to bring the diggers into closer union with one
another. By the organising of reform leagues and
committees the whole population became educated
to a certain degree in the discussion of their grievances,
and several men then came to the front who
in subsequent years became popular political and
social leaders. Among the changes contemplated by
the reform league at Ballarat may be mentioned:&mdash;(1)
Fair representation; (2) manhood suffrage; (3)
no property qualification for Members of Legislative
Council; (4) payment of Members, and short duration
of Parliaments. But its immediate object was
to obtain a change in the management of the gold-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>fields&mdash;the disbanding of Commissioners, and the
abolition of diggers' and storekeepers' license taxes.</p>

<p>The motives that prompted the diggers to oppose
the impost were never so unreservedly displayed as at
their public meetings; the telling speeches of those
"gifted with the gab" often heated the swelling
emotions of the listening multitude to almost a
bursting point. A lively view of a diggers' meeting
is thus depicted by Mr. W. Kelly:&mdash;"At length a
bell commenced ringing in front of a large tenement,
and all the different groups commingled in one
advancing crowd towards the entrance. I found
inside an extemporised platform at the end, on to
which I was ushered to a prominent place. The
proposers occupied a front row, striving to look as
if they were not aware of their being about to be
asked to take part in the proceedings, while I could
clearly see they were in communion with their
memories, calling to mind the concluding words in
pages so-and-so, and the starting word in the sentences
on the other leaves. The seconders were in
their proper position, got up without starch for the
occasion, all of the 'unaccustomed as I am' class.
The chairman, Mr. H&mdash;ff&mdash;y, was voted to his post
by acclamation, and Dr. C&mdash;&mdash;r 'broke open the
ball.' He had evidently read up for the occasion,
but studied harangues. Abstruse political theories
and polemical refinements are not the fitting elements
for popular oratory; his loftiest flights and his most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
studied cadences (none of them approaching mediocrity,
by the way) scarcely produced a fitful 'hear.'
It was evident that the audience paid no attention
to the contrasting illustrations between direct or
indirect taxation, or the grand theory of 'basing
representation on population instead of property;'
even the reference to 'unlocking the lands' elicited
only a languid meed of approbation. But when a
digger from the crowd asked aloud, 'What about
the b&mdash;y license tax?' there arose a simultaneous
shout as if from a roaring giant, which broke the
doctor's thread. He tried to stagger on, but after
a few stumbles he 'declined occupying any more of
their valuable time,' and sat down, to the apparent
delight of the whole crowd. The next speaker, and
the next, and the next, and the next still, were all of
a piece, and the cry of 'Shut up!' became impartially
applicable to all, until a rough, determined,
yet good-countenanced man, was lifted up in front.
He evidently did not court the prominence, but there
was no mistaking it; he was perfectly self-possessed,
his mind was full, and his undisciplined tongue 'was
all there.' He looked steadily around with his great
hand thrust into the breast of his open shirt, where
the mud-spattered hair was evident as his whiskers.
I felt sure I knew what was coming, and his first
clearly-pronounced words, 'Brother Diggers!' made
the assurance doubly sure. He bade them be of a
good heart, but to be <i>united</i>&mdash;emphasising the word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
He advised them to obey the Law, but denied the
legality of the license tax, which bore down upon
the industry that made the country great, and went
on pampering their persecutors. He drew a most
graphic picture of the tyranny of officials' enormities
of digger-hunting, and wound up by swearing 'while
he would die for his Queen, he would shed the last
drop of his blood before he would pay another
license.' The burst of enthusiasm that followed this
declaration is altogether indescribable. It seemed to
lift the great tent into mid-air; and, inoculated with
the glow of feeling around me, I could almost
imagine that I had a cloud for a footstool. The
speaker was seized, <i>nolo episcopari</i> notwithstanding,
and carried out in triumph to the open air, leaving
the chairman to dissolve the meeting, vote himself
thanks, and all the rest of it. It was then, in truth,
the <i>bonâ-fide</i> meeting commenced, and many a spirit-stirring
speech bearing close upon the one text was
delivered extemporaneously from the head of a
barrel or the end of a waggon."</p>

<p>The ill-will manifested at these gatherings was
kept fervid by the official tyranny which yet accompanied
the collecting of the tax, and its virulence
was much increased when the diggers learned that
the authorities employed informers whose histories
precluded the possibility of their acting truthfully,
and stamped them as men of straw, ready to swear
to anything at the official's bidding. Such a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of affairs so irritated the men as to cause the more
excitable to collect arms. Men of different nationalities
formed separate leagues; while throughout the
whole digging community the probability of open
insurrection was commonly discussed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>



<hr class="c65" />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="chsub"><i>THE EUREKA HOTEL MURDER.</i></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="alcap">t</span> last an incident caused the long-smouldering
elements of disaffection to burst out suddenly
in a blaze of infuriated indignation.</p>

<p>A digger named Scobie met an old chum of his,
and being overjoyed at the unexpected re-union,
hastened to show his good-fellowship by "shouting."
In the course of the day the two became drunk,
and attempted to enter Bentley's Eureka Hotel.
Being refused admittance, Scobie got troublesome.
An altercation ensued with the people of the hotel,
during which his head was split open with a spade.
The blow killed him. Bentley's Hotel was held in
disrepute by respectable miners, and its proprietor
was considered a bad character. An inquest was
held on the body of the murdered man. It was not
conducted with the care and discrimination which
should attend such an inquiry. The coroner's
verdict, "that the deceased died from the effects of
a wound inflicted by a person unknown," was so at
variance with public opinion, that another official
investigation was held, which indicted Bentley for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the killing of Scobie. At the police court the landlord
was acquitted, but the manner in which the
case was conducted made it patent to all that
justice had been trifled with. The Police Magistrate
was known to be intimate with the prisoner, and
was believed to be a sharer in his illicit gains. The
trial was so injudicially carried out, that the Junior
Commissioner, Mr. Johnston, took copies of the
evidence and forwarded them to the Attorney-General.</p>

<p>The diggers became furious upon hearing of this
acquittal, and on the 17th October 1854 assembled
in great numbers around Bentley's Hotel. They
expressed dissatisfaction at the result of the trial,
and subscribed money for the purposes of bringing
the case before more competent authorities, and of
offering a reward for the capture of the dastardly
murderers of Scobie. Soldiers were told off to the
gathering to nip in the bud any rebellious exhibitions
of wrath. While the diggers moved round
the spot, listening to indignant invectives of their
spokesmen, a lad in the crowd threw a stone which
narrowly missed a trooper, and smashed into pieces
a pane of the lamp in front of the hotel. The
police immediately tried to arrest the offender, and
then the surging crowd gave free vent to its feelings.
Stones and missiles of all kinds were thrown until
every window in the hotel was broken into atoms.
Madly infuriated, they rushed against the front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
door, almost battering it to pieces; and whilst the
tumultuous crowd were attacking the front of the
building, a man with a bundle of paper and other
inflammable materials got into the bowling-alley at
the rear and set the place on fire. The soldiers
made strenuous efforts to disperse the people and
save the hotel; but all in vain. Bentley succeeded
in escaping during the melée, and on a swift horse
rode to the Commissioners' camp for additional
assistance. Presently more soldiers arrived on the
scene, but it was too late to stop the flames, which
had by this time taken a firm hold of the building.
The immense blaze drew from the gravel pits all
the diggers, excepting those who happened to be
below and were unable to come up to the surface
without the help of their mates at the windlass,
who had impetuously left their posts in order to
take part in the demonstration against officialism
and injustice. The enveloping flames continued the
work of destruction by greedily licking up the
wooden beams and heavy columns, and finished
by reducing the whole building to a spread of
ashes.</p>

<p>For setting fire to the hotel three men well
known on the diggings were arrested. This so
incensed the diggers that they meditated an attack
on the Commissioners' camp and a forcible release
of the prisoners. However, after a time milder
propositions prevailed, and it was agreed that nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of the diggers should offer bail. Accordingly, a
deputation from the diggers went to the Commissioners,
and succeeded in bringing away the
three men, although at first the turbulence of the
crowd led the officials to think that the offer of
bail was merely a <i>ruse</i> to rescue the prisoners by
force while the bail-bonds were being prepared.
When the deputation came out of the camp with
the three released captives, the crowd of diggers
greeted them with such an impetuous rush that it
required the prompt efforts of both the deputation
and its charge to prevent a collision with the
soldiers. A monster indignation meeting followed,
at which the diggers collected £200 to be paid to
the discoverer of the murderer of Scobie. They
would have collected more had not the Government
also offered a reward and as well rearrested Bentley,
who this time was tried, convicted, and sentenced
to three years' hard labour. The corrupt Police
Magistrate shortly afterwards departed for more
congenial scenes.</p>

<p>The trial of the three men for the burning of the
hotel was held in Melbourne, and a number of the
diggers attended. The prisoners were convicted, but
with a strong recommendation to mercy, the jury
adding that they would not have had their painful
duty to perform if those entrusted with the government
at Ballarat had done their duty properly.
This rider to the verdict was received with loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and prolonged cheering by the crowded court. The
three men were severally sentenced to three, four,
and six months' imprisonment. This sentence was
considered so unjust by the diggers that they
promptly sent delegates to Melbourne to demand
the release of the prisoners.</p>

<p>On the 27th of November the deputation (Messrs.
Humffray, Kennedy, and Black) waited upon His
Excellency the Governor. He listened to their
remonstrances, but was so displeased with the
haughty tone assumed by them that he said, as
representative of Her Majesty, he could not allow
their peremptory demand. However, it was intimated
that if a proper memorial was sent to the
Government the prisoners might be released from
custody. But the delegates were forbidden by the
indignant diggers to plead with the authorities, and
therefore returned, leaving the object of their mission
unattained. The people on the diggings were
further incensed at this failure, and many now
busied themselves in preparing arms and ammunition,
while committees and leagues sat night and day.</p>

<p>The Government expected a violent outbreak of
passion, and made preparations for eventualities by
concentrating all available troops at Ballarat. The
ill-feeling of the gold-fields' population soon manifested
itself, several detachments of troops being
pelted with mud and other missiles while marching
along the diggings' thoroughfares. On the 28th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
November, as a party of soldiers from Melbourne
were approaching the camp at Ballarat, some diggers
in ambush suddenly made a raid on the military
waggons, in the hope of obtaining arms. They
wounded a few soldiers, and managed to overturn
several waggons and rifle their contents. But when
in the vicinity of their camp the soldiers rallied, and,
with the assistance of the mounted police, put the
marauders to flight, wounding some of them. A
crowd of men from the surrounding gullies left their
tents and came up to see the conflict, but were soon
driven away panic-stricken. It was eleven o'clock
before the troops quartered, but the noise made by
the diggers in keeping up huge fires, and continually
discharging fire-arms, prevented them from obtaining
any rest that night.</p>


<h4>A LOYAL TOAST.</h4>

<p>An episode which occurred on that turbulent
evening shows the general feeling of dissatisfaction
at the conduct of the officials. It is related by
Mr. Samuel Irwin, a correspondent of the <i>Geelong
Advertiser</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A dinner was given by the American residents
of Ballarat to the American Consul, and most of the
leading residents of all nationalities were there. Just
as the toasts were about to be proposed, a message
was received by Mr. Commissioner Rede, stating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
that an attack had been made on some troops
coming from Melbourne when they reached the
workings on the Eureka lead. The Commissioner
and other officials withdrew at once, as the report
was that several lives had been lost. When the
toast of the Queen was proposed, a significant fact
was disclosed&mdash;for several minutes no one would
respond to it. The duty of responding had originally
been allotted to the resident Commissioner, who had
left for the scene of the outrage. Many British
subjects (business men and miners) were present,
yet they sat without the slightest attempt to show
their loyalty until the chairman said if no British
subject would volunteer for the duty, he must do
so himself. At length a gentleman undertook to
respond. He very pithily said, 'While I and my
fellow-colonists claim to be and are thoroughly loyal
to our Sovereign Lady the Queen, we do not and
will not respect her man-servants, her maid-servants,
her oxen, or her <i>asses</i>.' The last word was delivered
with an emphasis, and received with tumultuous
applause."</p>


<h4>BURNING THE LICENSES.</h4>

<p>We learn from Withers' <i>History of Ballarat</i> that
a monstre meeting was called by the reform league
for the 29th of November, on Bakery Hill, at
which some thousands were expected from Creswick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
besides delegates from all the other gold-fields;
for the movement had now become general, and
emissaries had been sent all over the colony to
enlist sympathy, procure help, and, in fact, make
the rising national, if not revolutionary. At the
meeting on the 29th, Humffray and the other
delegates (Black and Kennedy) gave in their report
of the conference with the Governor.</p>

<p>Some 12,000 men, it is said, were present at the
meeting. A platform was erected, and on a flagstaff
was hung the insurgent flag&mdash;the Southern Cross.
The flag had a blue ground, on which, in silver,
the four principal stars of the constellation of the
Southern Cross were shown. Mr. Hayes was the
chairman, and the site of the meeting was on the
adjoining area, now occupied by Victoria Street,
between East and Humffray Streets. Besides the
committee of the league and the delegates, there
were reporters on the platform, and two Roman
Catholic priests&mdash;the Rev. Fathers Downing and
Smyth. The Catholic Bishop had also come to help
to maintain peace.</p>

<p>Resolutions condemnatory of the action of the
authorities were adopted unanimously. It was
proposed:&mdash;"That this meeting, being convinced
that the obnoxious license fee is an imposition, and
an unjustifiable tax on free labour, pledges itself to
take immediate steps to abolish the same by at once
burning all their licenses. That, in the event of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
party being arrested for having no licenses, the
united people will, under all circumstances, defend
and protect them."</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;"That as the diggers have to pay
no licenses, it is necessary for them to be prepared
for the contingency, as it would be utterly inconsistent,
after refusing to pay a license, to call in a
Commissioner for the adjustment of such disputes;
and this meeting resolves, whenever any party or
parties have a dispute, the parties so disputing shall
each appoint one man, the two men thus appointed
to call in a third, and these three to decide the case
finally."</p>

<p>Mr. Humffray proposed, and Mr. Kennedy
seconded:&mdash;"That this meeting protests against the
common practice of bodies of military marching into
a peaceable district with fixed bayonets, and also
any force, police or otherwise, firing on the people,
under any circumstances, without the previous reading
of the Riot Act; and that if Government officials
continue to act thus unconstitutionally, we cannot
be responsible for similar or worse deeds from the
people."</p>

<p>The proposals were received with acclamation, and
carried vociferously; and had it not been for the
chairman and his supporters' interference, the men
that ventured to hint of milder and more constitutional
measures would have been torn limb from
limb by the infuriated diggers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Bonfires were made of licenses; guns and revolvers
were discharged; and league tickets of membership
were issued to the crowd. Troops were under arms
in the gully beneath the camp all the time, waiting in
readiness for an outbreak.</p>


<h4>THE LAST DIGGER-HUNT.</h4>

<p>"With incredible want of prudence, the authorities
chose the juncture marked by the meeting of the
29th of November for a more irritating display than
usual of the so long condemned practice of digger-hunting.
On the 30th of November the last raid of
this kind in Victoria occurred, under the direction
of Commissioners Rede and Johnston, and the
authorities by that act destroyed the remaining
influence of the friends of moral force among the
diggers. The police, supported by the whole military
force available, with skirmishers in advance and
cavalry on the flanks, formed on the flat south of
the camp, and advanced upon the Gravel Pits, as the
Bakery Hill diggings were called. This cleared
the swarming crowd of diggers collected there, the
diggers retiring as the troops advanced. At certain
parts of the main road, however, the diggers made
a stand, and received the troops with a running fire
of stones and occasional gun-shots. The troops took
some prisoners, and returned to the camp. Soon
after that the Southern Cross was again hoisted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Bakery Hill; the diggers knelt round the flag, swore
mutual defence, and implored the help of God. New
leaders came to the front, as the advocates of moral
force were discomfited by the authorities and the
more turbulent insurgents." Peter Lalor, a native of
the Queen's County, Ireland, who has since become
one of our most prominent and respected legislators,
assumed a foremost position at this dangerous turn
of affairs. A fiery-spirited Italian, named Carboni
Raffello, was another who then placed himself in the
front rank of the diggers' movement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>



<hr class="c65" />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="chsub"><i>THE EUREKA STOCKADE.</i></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="alcap">he</span> insurgents had pitched upon the junction
of the Eureka lead with the Melbourne road
as a place suitable for meeting <i>en masse</i>. About
an acre of the ground was roughly enclosed with
slabs, and within this area the diggers commenced
their drilling. The slabs were put up as a screen
merely, so that the preparations for revolt might
not be too closely watched. This frail enclosure
received the name of the Eureka Stockade.</p>

<p>Lalor delivered a speech within this stockade. It
was couched thus:&mdash;"Gentlemen, I find myself in
this responsible position for the following reasons.
Outraged at the unaccountable conduct of the camp
officials in the wicked license-hunt at the point of
the bayonet, the diggers took it as an insult to
their manhood, and a challenge to the determination
expressed at their monstre meeting. They ran to
arms, and crowded on Bakery Hill. They wanted
a leader, but no one came forward, and confusion
was the consequence. I mounted the stump, and
called on the people to fall in into divisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
according to the arms they had got, and to choose
their captains out of the best men among themselves.
My call was answered with unanimous acclamation,
and complied to with willing obedience. The result
is, I have been able to bring about that order without
which it would be folly to face the impending
struggle like men. I make no pretentions to military
knowledge. I have not the presumption to assume
the chief command no more than any other man
who means well in the cause of the diggers. I shall
be glad to see the best man take the lead. In fact,
gentlemen, I expected someone who is really well
known to you to come forward and direct our
movement! However, if you appoint me your
commander-in-chief, I shall not shrink; I mean
to do my duty as a man. I tell you that if once
I pledge my hand to the diggers, I will neither
defile it by treachery nor render it contemptible by
cowardice."</p>

<p>Raffello, who had a great admiration for Lalor's
straightforwardness and many other manly qualities,
comments thus:&mdash;"Bravo, Peter, you gave us your
hand on the Eureka, and left there your arm," an
incontestible proof of the sincerity of Lalor's pledge.</p>

<p>Lalor was appointed commander-in-chief. In
thanking the council for the confidence placed in
him, he told them he was determined to prepare
the diggers to resist force by force; but at the
same time it was perfectly understood by every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>one present that the organisation was solely for
defence.</p>

<p>In the stockade a straight pole, eighty feet long,
was erected to serve as a flag-staff. At the head
of this the diggers hoisted their standard&mdash;the
Southern Cross. Then Lalor, gun in hand, mounted
a stump. Resting the stock of the gun on his foot,
and grasping its barrel firmly in his left hand, he
slowly raised his right arm towards the standard,
and proceeded solemnly to swear in the diggers.
He said, "It is my duty to take from you the oath
to be faithful to the standard. The man who, after
this solemn oath, does not stand by our standard
is a coward at heart." All those who did not intend
to take part in the insurrection were ordered to
leave the meeting. Then the armed diggers,
numbering about five hundred, gathered around the
flag-staff. They were formed into divisions, and
the captains of each saluted their commander-in-chief.
He now knelt down, and solemnly pointing
to the standard streaming in the breeze, said, in
firm, serious, and glowing tones, "We swear by
the standard to stand truly by each other and fight
to defend our rights and liberties;" to which the
diggers responded decisively by a universal "Amen,"
and by simultaneously stretching five hundred hands
towards the flag.</p>

<p>Immediately after the swearing-in ceremony the
names were taken down and the men formed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
squads for drill. Drilling was kept up with but
little intermission till a late hour, and was now and
then renewed up to the capture of the stockade.
Side by side with these warlike preparations several
claims were being worked; indeed, some of the
working miners gave up their tents as quarters for
insurgent officers.</p>

<p>Orders of war were sent round the diggings to
obtain arms, ammunition, etc. Lalor was obliged
to keep piquets to enforce these orders, and also
to prevent their being made a cover for robbery,
because some unscrupulous diggers had, in the
name of the insurgents, pillaged the storekeepers.
The levying officers issued receipts on behalf of the
Reform League. Some of these are rather entertaining
documents. Here is one: "Received from
the Ballarat store, 1 Pistol for the Comtee x. Hugh
McCarty&mdash;Hurrah for the people!" Another: "The
Reform Lege Comete, 4 drenks, fower chillings, 4
Pies, for fower of thee neight watch troops xP."
The four night watch troops were some of those
insurgents told off to patrol the diggings. The
foragers, as things came to a crisis, became more
peremptory in their demands, one party even
threatening to shoot a storekeeper if he did not
hand over quickly. But, notwithstanding the levying,
the insurgents failed to obtain sufficient war material.
Several of their fire-arms were afterwards found
loaded with pebbles and such missiles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Lalor's men kept together within the stockade,
some cooking the meat which friendly butchers had
brought in; others mending muskets or making pikes
or similar rude weapons for use by the several
companies of pikemen. Friends and enemies also
dropped into the stockade at all hours until the day
before the tragic event.</p>

<p>Humffray, ever foremost in advocating peaceful
reform, heard, when in the stockade, of a project to
attack the soldiers' camp. It was thought that 2000
diggers could be got for that purpose. Humffray,
with other mild spirits, vainly endeavoured to persuade
them from attempting it, and then left the
stockade.</p>

<p>Vinegar Hill was the pass-word on the night of the
2nd of December, and its ominous associations led
several to abandon what they saw was a badly-organised
and hopeless movement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the soldiers had not been idle. After
securing a commanding position on the rising ground
afterwards known as "Soldiers' Hill," they vigilantly
watched the movements of the insurgents. The
police were also on the alert, so that little was said
or done among the insurgents that was not soon
afterwards reported to the authorities.</p>

<p>A Government officer, then in the camp, writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the 1st of December the Government took
final measures to meet the assault. Every Government
employee was armed and told off to his post,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and sentinels and videttes were placed at every point.
The principal buildings of the camp were fortified
with breastworks of firewood, trusses of hay, and
bags of corn from the Commissariat Stores, and the
women and children were sent for security into the
store, which was walled with thick slabs and
accounted bullet-proof. A violent storm of rain,
with thunder, commenced as these arrangements
were completed, and the mounted police, soaked
through with rain, spent the night standing or lying
by their horses, armed, and horses saddled ready for
instant action. At four <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on the 2nd of December
the whole garrison was under arms, and soon after
daylight a demonstration in force was made towards
Bakery Hill without opposition, although bodies of
men were seen drilling near the Red Hill. A
mounted trooper coming from Melbourne with despatches
was fired at near the Eureka lead. No
work was carried on through the entire diggings,
and every place of business was closed. Notices
were issued stating that if any lights were seen in
the neighbourhood after eight o'clock at night, or if
any fire-arms were discharged, the offenders would be
fired at by the military." The same Government
officer writes about the</p>


<h4>STORMING OF THE STOCKADE.</h4>

<p>"Before daylight on the morning of the 3rd of
December a mixed force of two hundred and seventy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>-six men, including a strong body of cavalry, quietly
left the camp for the purpose of taking the stockade.
At early dawn they reached the neighbourhood of the
position sought, and the advance files were fired at by
a sentinel within the stockade. The order to attack
was given, and the 40th regiment, led by Captain
Thomas, the chief officer in command, made a quick
advance upon the double breastwork which formed
the stronghold of the insurgents. After several
volleys had been fired on both sides, a barrier of
ropes, slabs, and overturned carts was crossed, and
the defenders driven out or into the shallow pits
with which the place was spotted, and in which
many were put to death in the first heat of the
conflict either by bullets or by bayonet thrusts."</p>

<p>Raffello says&mdash;"I awoke on Sunday morning. A
discharge of musketry&mdash;then a round from a bugle&mdash;the
command 'Forward'&mdash;and another discharge of
musketry was sharply kept up by the red-coats for a
couple of minutes. The shots whizzed by my tent.
I jumped out of my stretcher and rushed to my
chimney facing the stockade. The force within could
not muster then above one hundred and fifty diggers.
The shepherds' holes inside the lower part of the
stockade were turned into rifle pits.... The dragoons
from the south and troopers from the north
were trotting at full speed towards the stockade.
Peter Lalor was on top of the first logged-up hole
within the stockade, and by his decided gestures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
pointed to the men to retire among the holes. He
was shot down in his shoulder at this identical
moment. It was a chance shot. I recollect it well,
for the discharge of musketry from the military now
mowed down all who had heads above the barricades....
Those who suffered most were the pikemen, who
stood their ground from the time the whole division
had been posted on top, facing the Melbourne road
from Ballarat, in double file under the slabs to stick
the cavalry with their pikes. The old command
'Charge' was distinctly heard, and the red-coats ran
with fixed bayonets to storm the stockade. A few
cuts and kicks, a little pulling down, and the job was
done; too quickly for their wonted ardour, for they
actually thrust their bayonets through the bodies of
the dead and wounded strewed about the ground. A
wild hurrah burst out, and the 'Southern Cross' was
torn down. Of the armed diggers, some made off the
best way they could, others surrendered themselves as
prisoners, and were collected in groups and marched
down the gully.... The red-coats were now
ordered to 'fall in,' their bloody work being over, and
were marched off, dragging with them the 'Southern
Cross.'"</p>

<p>In less than twenty-five minutes the engagement
was over, and the soldiers had possession of the
stockade and one hundred and twenty-five prisoners.
During the same day the soldiers who were killed in
the inglorious conflict were buried in the cemetery;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and no opposition was offered to the dead bodies of
the insurgents being placed in rough coffins and taken
away by their sorrowing friends.</p>

<p>After the fray notices were posted up at various
places ordering all well-disposed persons to return
to their ordinary occupations, and to abstain from
assembling in large groups. The soldiers then
returned to their camp, but remained under arms
all night, rumours of an intended attack keeping
them on the alert, although it was tiring work; and
most of them, having had no repose for four nights,
were almost exhausted.</p>

<p>On the next evening a number of insurgents,
favoured by a clouded moon, crept up under the cover
of the nearest tent beyond the palisade and fired from
several points upon the sentinels. This caused a
sudden alarm in the camp; everyone ran to his post,
and a general firing followed, resulting in the wounding
of a woman and child in one of the tents and of
three men on the road close by, who unfortunately
happened to be passing.</p>

<p>On the 5th of December Major-General Sir Robert
Nickle arrived with a relief contingent from Melbourne,
and later in the day a force of eight hundred
soldiers and a large party of seamen from the men-of-war
then in the bay still further strengthened
the hands of the Government. The presence of
these additional troops had immediate effect throughout
the digging community in sinking below zero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the spirit of insurrection, which was already depressed
by the loss of the Eureka stockade. Sir Robert was
a veteran well skilled in quelling disturbances. The
district was now under martial law, but his good
sense made it more acceptable to the diggers than
the previous administration of the Commissioners.</p>

<p>The soldiers were kept at Ballarat until affairs on
the gold-fields resumed a more peaceful course; then,
as no further tumults were apprehended, Sir Robert
Nickle and his forces returned to Melbourne, leaving
a small garrison to await the turn of events.</p>


<h4>EXCITEMENT IN MELBOURNE.</h4>

<p>Meanwhile, the Government were making other
strenuous efforts to restore order, and favouring the
report that the leaders of the revolutionary movement
were foreigners, issued notices, calling upon British
subjects not only to abstain from identifying themselves
with persons who were endeavouring to excite
the mining population to riotous courses, but to
render support and assistance to the authorities,
civil and military, then stationed at Ballarat. At
the same time £500 was offered for the arrest of a
German named Vern, whom the Government believed
to be the chief instigator of the outbreak. Civilians
in Melbourne, Geelong, and various towns in the
colony were requested to come forward and be
sworn in as special constables.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>From McCombie's <i>History of Victoria</i> we learn:&mdash;"That
the Legislative Council presented to the
Governor an address expressing their sympathy for
him and pledging their support to him while affairs
were so embarrassing." Sir Charles Hotham replied,
"That the firm resolve to suppress the incipient
revolution was softened by the readiness with which
he offered to redress the grievances complained of.
It would be his constant endeavour to conduct the
Government with the utmost possible temper. The
time for military rule had passed, but when there was
an outbreak, and that caused by foreigners&mdash;men
who had not been suffered to remain in their own
country in consequence of the violence of their
character&mdash;then Englishmen must sink all minor
differences and unite to support the authorities."</p>

<p>The Government, however, fared differently when
a direct appeal was made to the people. At
Melbourne a public meeting had been called by
requisition to consider the best means for protecting
the city during the crisis at the diggings. The
principal agitators in this matter seemed to be the
members of the Legislature, who took a large share
in the proceedings of this public meeting. The
resolutions proposed were received with such ill-concealed
dissatisfaction that, after the Mayor had
declared two of them to be carried, the opponents
of the Government interfered, and such confusion
prevailed that the gentleman who presided vacated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the chair; and a series of resolutions, diametrically
opposed to the proceedings of the Executive, and
demanding an immediate settlement of the differences
between the Government and the diggers,
were carried with the utmost enthusiasm. One
speaker told the people they must go forth with
their brother-diggers to conquer or die.</p>

<p>"The Government demonstration having terminated
in so unsatisfactory a manner, another meeting
was convened on the following day, 'for the assertion
of order and the protection of constitutional liberty.'
It took place on a large open space of ground near
St. Paul's Church, at the corner of Flinder's Lane.
From four to seven thousand people were present,
the chair being filled by Henry Langlands, one of
the largest employers of labour in Melbourne. The
resolutions condemned the whole policy of the
Government, and declared that, while disapproving
of the physical resistance offered by the diggers,
the meeting could not, without betraying the interests
of liberty, lend its aid to the Executive until the
coercive measures they were attempting to introduce
should be abandoned. The result of this
meeting had very considerable weight with the
Executive, and the same afternoon a <i>Government
Gazette</i> extraordinary appeared, in which was a proclamation
revoking martial law at Ballarat."</p>

<p>A few days before the outbreak a Commission
had been appointed to inquire into the state of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
mining districts, and now, in deference to the feelings
shown at the public meetings, several gentlemen
were added to it, in order to find out the grounds
of the diggers' complaints. The Commissioner urged
the Government to grant a general amnesty as to
the past; but the Government considered that some
of the prisoners taken in the stockade should be
tried for high treason.</p>

<p>A monstre meeting was therefore held in Melbourne,
at which it was resolved, "That the unhappy
outbreak at Ballarat was induced by no traitorous designs
against the institution of monarchy, but purely
by a sense of political wrong and irritation, engendered
by the injudicious and offensive enforcement
of an obnoxious and invidious tax, which, if legal,
has since been condemned by the Commission."
Thousands in Ballarat subscribed a similar petition.</p>

<p>But the Executive remained obdurate, and on the
18th of January issued a public notice offering £400,
£200 each, for the arrest of Lalor and Black, because
of their treasonable and seditious language in inciting
men to take up arms against the Queen.</p>

<p>The insurgent chief, Lalor, was severely wounded
whilst defending the stockade. He fell to the
ground. Some of his pikemen seeing his body,
covered it with slabs. When the soldiers retired
with their prisoners, he managed to extricate himself
from the <i>débris</i> and make his way to his
friends. On the following day his left arm had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
be amputated. He secreted himself in various
friendly huts at different places, and after several
narrow escapes, succeeded in eluding the police in
their search for fugitives. His friends proving true
to him, notwithstanding the reward of £200, he
ultimately reached Geelong, where he remained until
the storm of general disapproval had extinguished
the desire of the authorities for his capture.</p>

<p>In the opinion of many, the agitation at Ballarat
was constitutional at first, and had assumed its
unconstitutional form in consequence of the coercion
of the Commissioners, who precipitated measures
by their imprudent digger-hunting during the period
of excitement.</p>

<p>However, the Government continued the prosecution
of the rioters, despite their being the
objects of public sympathy. The trial was ended on
the 1st of April by the jury acquitting the prisoners,
a result which had been generally anticipated.</p>


<h4>WRONGS RIGHTED.</h4>

<p>The insurrectionists were afterwards conciliated by
the efforts of the Commission of Inquiry, and consequent
redress of grievances. The revolt, in addition
to the valuable lives lost, cost the colony £20,000
for military expenses, extra police charges, and compensation
to sufferers.</p>

<p>From Westgarth's <i>Colony of Victoria</i> we extract:&mdash;"The
Commission produced a lengthened report,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
in which the whole system of gold-fields' management
was proposed to be reconstituted. The miners'
earnings were found to be, on an average, rather
smaller than those of other branches of colonial
labour&mdash;a circumstance not favourable to the
persistent maintenance of a heavy license fee of
practically very unequal incidence. The report
recommended the abolition of this fee, and in its
place the imposition of a moderate export duty on
gold. The issue of a 'Miner's Right' was suggested,
at a cost to each miner of one pound a-year, and
conferring upon him both the mining privileges and
the franchise. The title of 'Commissioner' to the
head of each gold-field, a name now associated with
the wranglings of the past, was proposed to be
changed to the old English mining title, 'Warden.'
The Commissioners recommended local elective
mining courts, and benches of local unpaid justices
of the peace, who should sit with the regular paid
magistrate. The more intelligent of the miners
were constituted local justices of the peace, and
arrangements were made by which the mining
districts elected their own representatives to the
'Colonial Legislature.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Peter Lalor<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> was one of the first of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
representatives, and has since been in several
ministries, and twice Speaker of the Assembly.</p>

<p>Thus ended one of the few unfortunate incidents
of Australian history. The miners have since been
as loyal as any other section of the population, and,
by their industrious delving in the seemingly inexhaustible
gold mines of Victoria, they have contributed
a full share towards the prosperity of the
colony.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
